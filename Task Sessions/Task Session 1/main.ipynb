      "[\"Multimodal imaging Gd-nanoparticles functionalized with Pittsburgh compound B or a nanobody for amyloid plaques targeting. Aim: Gadolinium-based nanoparticles were functionalized with either the Pittsburgh compound B or a nanobody (B10AP) in order to create multimodal tools for an early diagnosis of amyloidoses. Materials & methods: The ability of the functionalized nanoparticles to target amyloid fibrils made of β-amyloid peptide, amylin or Val30Met-mutated transthyretin formed in vitro or from pathological tissues was investigated by a range of spectroscopic and biophysics techniques including fluorescence microscopy. Results: Nanoparticles functionalized by both probes efficiently interacted with the three types of amyloid fibrils, with KD values in 10 micromolar and 10 nanomolar range for, respectively, Pittsburgh compound B and B10AP nanoparticles. Moreover, they allowed the detection of amyloid deposits on pathological tissues. Conclusion: Such functionalized nanoparticles could represent promising flexible and multimodal imaging tools for the early diagnostic of amyloid diseases, in other words, Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus and the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.\", 'Robustness of spatio-temporal regularization in perfusion MRI deconvolution: An application to acute ischemic stroke. Purpose: The robustness of a recently introduced globally convergent deconvolution algorithm with temporal and edge-preserving spatial regularization for the deconvolution of dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion magnetic resonance imaging is assessed in the context of ischemic stroke. Theory and Methods: Ischemic tissues are not randomly distributed in the brain but form a spatially organized entity. The addition of a spatial regularization term allows to take into account this spatial organization contrarily to the sole temporal regularization approach which processes each voxel independently. The robustness of the spatial regularization in relation to shape variability, hemodynamic variability in tissues, noise in the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus, and uncertainty on the arterial input function selected for the deconvolution is addressed via an original in silico validation approach. Results: The deconvolution algorithm proved robust to the different sources of variability, outperforming temporal Tikhonov regularization in most realistic conditions considered. The limiting factor is the proper estimation of the arterial input function. Conclusion: This study quantified the robustness of a spatio-temporal approach for dynamic susceptibility contrast-magnetic resonance imaging deconvolution via a new simulator. This simulator, now accessible online, is of wide applicability for the validation of any deconvolution algorithm. Magn Reson Med 78:1981–1990, 2017. © 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.', \"Reachability judgement in optic ataxia: Effect of peripheral vision on hand and target perception in depth. The concept of peripersonal space was first proposed by Rizzolatti, Scandolara, Matelli, and Gentilucci (1981), who introduced the term to highlight the close links between somatosensory and visual processing for stimuli close to the body and suggested that this near-body space could in fact be characterized as an action space (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, & Gallese, 1997). Supporting this idea, patients with right hemisphere lesions have been described as impaired in performing actions towards objects and in perceiving their location − but only when the objects were presented within arm's reach (Bartolo, Carlier, Hassaini, Martin, & Coello, 2014; Brain, 1941). Whether the deficit of optic ataxia patients in processing target locations for action has an effect on the representation of peripersonal space has never been explored. The present study highlights optic ataxia patients’ specific difficulties in processing hand-to-target distances in a motor task and in a perceptual task requiring identification of what is reachable in the visual environment. The difficulties are especially evident when both the target and the hand are perceived in the visual periphery. Indeed, when patient I.G. was able to fixate the target, her reaching accuracy and her perception of reachable space both largely improved. Furthermore, the difficulties were enhanced when the hand and the target were both in the lower visual field (in a fixed-far condition vs a fixed-near condition). This novel up-down dimension of optic ataxia fits with the larger representation of the lower visual field in the posterior parietal cortex (Pitzalis et al., 2013; Previc, 1990).\", 'How Does Sensor-Space Group Blind Source Separation Face Inter-individual Neuroanatomical Variability? Insights from a Simulation Study Based on the PALS-B12 Atlas. Because of volume conduction and inter-individual neuroanatomical variability, similar sources in different brains may lead to variable topographies. This represents a major limitation for sensor-space group level decomposition of electroencephalographic data, a technique which introduces potential biases when aggregating individual data. To which extent this impedes subsequent source separation and localization was quantified in the present study. To this end, several simulations using an atlas of human cerebral cortex that takes into account the variability of cortical morphology (Van Essen in NeuroImage 28:635–662, 2005) were performed. For each virtual subject (up to n\\xa0=\\xa0160), the orientation and location of each single simulated dipole was randomly modified as a function of the variability of the cortical shape of a given point in the brain provided by the probabilistic atlas. The resulting activity was projected on the scalp, and topographical shifts were estimated. Then, different algorithms based on second order statistics (SOS) or higher order statistics were used to recover the simulated sources from sensor space information with group blind source separation (gBSS) procedures (based on UWSOBI or EFICA, respectively). As expected, the variability of orientation of the cortical surface across subjects was found to induce substantial variability in scalp potential maps, especially if the sources originate from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the temporoparietal junction. These biases could be compensated for by increasing drastically the number of subjects included in the topographical analyses. By contrast, gBSS was found to be insensitive to inter-individual differences of neuroanatomy. Rather, the estimation of the spatial filters seems to be optimized for the population of interest. Thus, optimal performance of source separation and subsequent source localization did not require the inclusion of a large sample of subjects (n\\xa0<\\xa020), at least when applying SOS-based statistics that use source spectral diversity to identify and gather similar sources with variable location and orientation. The resulting conclusion that inter-individual neuroanatomical variability is not a major limitation to sensor-space gBSS methods provides boosting perspectives for this promising approach, especially for the detection and localization of task/population related neural sources.', 'Impairment of the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism enzyme SHMT2 causes a novel brain and heart developmental syndrome. ', 'Subcellular specificity of cannabinoid effects in striatonigral circuits. Recent advances in neuroscience have positioned brain circuits as key units in controlling behavior, implying that their positive or negative modulation necessarily leads to specific behavioral outcomes. However, emerging evidence suggests that the activation or inhibition of specific brain circuits can actually produce multimodal behavioral outcomes. This study shows that activation of a receptor at different subcellular locations in the same neuronal circuit can determine distinct behaviors. Pharmacological activation of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors in the striatonigral circuit elicits both antinociception and catalepsy in mice. The decrease in nociception depends on the activation of plasma membrane-residing CB1 receptors (pmCB1), leading to the inhibition of cytosolic PKA activity and substance P release. By contrast, mitochondrial-associated CB1 receptors (mtCB1) located at the same terminals mediate cannabinoid-induced catalepsy through the decrease in intra-mitochondrial PKA-dependent cellular respiration and synaptic transmission. Thus, subcellular-specific CB1 receptor signaling within striatonigral circuits determines multimodal control of behavior.', 'Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers. Dysregulation of the stress response system is a potential etiological factor in the development of and relapse to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Previously we reported that repeated intermittent D-amphetamine administration can lead to progressively greater dopamine release, thereby providing evidence of drug-induced neurochemical sensitization. Here, we test the hypothesis that repeated exposure to D-amphetamine increases dopaminergic responses to stress; that is, produces cross-sensitization. Using positron emission tomography, we measured in 17 healthy male volunteers (mean±s.d.=22.1± 3.4 years) [11C]raclopride binding responses to a validated psychosocial stress task before and 2 weeks after a regimen of repeated D-amphetamine (3 × 0.3 mg kg-1, by mouth; n= 8) or placebo (3 × lactose, by mouth; n =9). Mood and physiological measurements were recorded throughout each session. Before the D-amphetamine regimen, exposure to the stress task increased behavioral and physiological indices of stress (anxiety, heart rate, cortisol, all P ≤ 0.05). Following the D-amphetamine regimen, the stress-induced cortisol responses were augmented (P<0.04), and voxel-based analyses showed larger stress-induced decreases in [11C]raclopride non-displaceable binding potential across the striatum. In the placebo group, re-exposure to stress led to smaller clusters of decreased [11C]raclopride binding, primarily in the sensorimotor striatum (P<0.05). Together, this study provides evidence for drug × stress cross-sensitization; moreover, random exposure to stimulants and/or stress cumulatively, while enhancing dopamine release in striatal areas, may contribute to a lowered set point for psychopathologies in which altered dopamine neurotransmission is invoked.', 'Mental fatigue correlates with depression of task-related network and augmented DMN activity but spares the reward circuit. Long-lasting and demanding cognitive activity typically leads to mental fatigue (MF). Indirect evidence suggests that MF may be caused by altered motivational processes. Here, we hypothesized that if MF consists in an alteration of motivational states, brain functional changes induced by MF could specifically affect the brain motivation circuit. In order to test this hypothesis, we devised a functional neuroimaging protocol to detect altered brain activity in reward-related brain regions in relation to cognitively induced mental fatigue. Twenty-five healthy participants underwent a FATIGUE and a CONTROL session on different days. In the FATIGUE session, MF was induced by performing a demanding cognitive task (adapted Stroop task) during 90 min, whereas in the CONTROL session, participants were asked to read magazines for the same period of time. We measured the neural consequences of the MF induction during a working memory task (Missing Number task) while modulating extrinsic motivation with block-wise variations in monetary reward. We also tracked participants’ momentary fatigue, anxiety state and intrinsic motivation prior to and following the MF inducement and measurement. Accuracy on the Missing Number Task was lower in the FATIGUE than in the CONTROL condition. Furthermore, subjective MF, but not its behavioral manifestations, was associated with hypoactivity of the task-evoked neural responses. Importantly, activity in regions modulated by reward showed no differences between FATIGUE and CONTROL sessions. In parallel, subjective MF correlated with increased on-task activity and resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network. These results indicate that subjective mental fatigue is not associated with altered activity in the brain motivation circuit but rather with hypoactivity in task-specific brain regions as well as relative increases of activity and connectivity in the default mode network during and after the task.', 'Purification of synaptosome populations using fluorescence-activated synaptosome sorting. For several decades, neurobiologists have used subcellular fractionation methods to analyze the molecular structure and some functional features of the cells in the central nervous system. Indeed, brain tissue contains a complex intermingled network of neuronal, glial, and vascular cells. To reduce this complexity biochemists have optimized fractionation protocols that enrich in specific compartments such as synapses (called “synaptosomes”) and synaptic vesicles, for example. However, recently, these approaches suffered from a lack of specificity and purity. In a recent effort, we extended the conventional synaptosome preparation to purify fluorescent synaptosomes on a cell sorter. We could prove that our method allows for the steep enrichment in fluorescent excitatory VGLUT1venus synaptosomes containing the presynaptic element and the tip of the post-synaptic element and a strong depletion in neuronal and glial contaminants. Here, we propose a detailed procedure for the implementation of Fluorescence Activated Synaptosome Sorting.', 'Dual anterograde and retrograde viral tracing of reciprocal connectivity. Current large-scale approaches in neuroscience aim to unravel the complete connectivity map of specific neuronal circuits, or even the entire brain. This emerging research discipline has been termed connectomics. Recombinant glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus (RABV ΔG) has become an important tool for the investigation of neuronal connectivity in the brains of a variety of species. Neuronal infection with even a single RABV ΔG particle results in high-level transgene expression, revealing the fine-detailed morphology of all neuronal features—including dendritic spines, axonal processes, and boutons—on a brain-wide scale. This labeling is eminently suitable for subsequent post-hoc morphological analysis, such as semiautomated reconstruction in 3D. Here we describe the use of a recently developed anterograde RABV ΔG variant together with a retrograde RABV ΔG for the investigation of projections both to, and from, a particular brain region. In addition to the automated reconstruction of a dendritic tree, we also give as an example the volume measurements of axonal boutons following RABV ΔG-mediated fluorescent marker expression. In conclusion RABV ΔG variants expressing a combination of markers and/or tools for stimulating/ monitoring neuronal activity, used together with genetic or behavioral animal models, promise important insights in the structure–function relationship of neural circuits.', 'A SENtence Supramodal Areas AtlaS (SENSAAS) based on multiple task-induced activation mapping and graph analysis of intrinsic connectivity in 144 healthy right-handers. We herein propose an atlas of 32 sentence-related areas based on a 3-step method combining the analysis of activation and asymmetry during multiple language tasks with hierarchical clustering of resting-state connectivity and graph analyses. 144 healthy right-handers performed fMRI runs based on language production, reading and listening, both with sentences and lists of over-learned words. Sentence minus word-list BOLD contrast and left-minus-right BOLD asymmetry for each task were computed in pairs of homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) from the AICHA atlas. Thirty-two hROIs were identified that were conjointly activated and leftward asymmetrical in each of the three language contrasts. Analysis of resting-state temporal correlations of BOLD variations between these 32 hROIs allowed the segregation of a core network, SENT_CORE including 18 hROIs. Resting-state graph analysis applied to SENT_CORE hROIs revealed that the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus were hubs based on their degree centrality (DC), betweenness, and participation values corresponding to epicentres of sentence processing. Positive correlations between DC and BOLD activation values for SENT_CORE hROIs were observed across individuals and across regions regardless of the task: the more a SENT_CORE area is connected at rest the stronger it is activated during sentence processing. DC measurements in SENT_CORE may thus be a valuable index for the evaluation of inter-individual variations in language areas functional activity in relation to anatomical or clinical patterns in large populations. SENSAAS (SENtence Supramodal Areas AtlaS), comprising the 32 supramodal sentence areas, including SENT_CORE network, can be downloaded at http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/.', 'Hierarchical Microstructure Informed Tractography. Background: Tractography uses diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to noninvasively infer the macroscopic pathways of white matter fibers and it is the only available technique to probe in vivo the structural connectivity of the brain. However, despite this unique and compelling ability and its wide range of possible neurological applications, tractography is still limited, lacks anatomical precision, and suffers from a serious sensitivity/specificity trade-off. For this reason, in the past few years, tractography postprocessing techniques have emerged and proved effective for improving the quality of the reconstructions. Among them, the Convex Optimization Modeling for Microstructure Informed Tractography formulation allows incorporating the anatomical prior that fibers are naturally organized in fascicles, and has obtained exceptional results in increasing the accuracy of the estimated tractograms. Methods: We propose an extension to this idea and introduce a multilevel grouping of the streamlines to capture the white matter arrangement in fascicles and subfascicles. We tested our proposed formulation in synthetic and in vivo data. Results: Our experiments show that using multiple levels allows considering information about the white matter organization more adequately and helps to improve further the accuracy of the resulting tractograms. Conclusion: This new formulation represents a further important step toward a more accurate structural connectivity estimation.', 'Ambroxol effects in glucocerebrosidase and α-synuclein transgenic mice. Objective: Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase 1 gene that result in deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Both homozygous and heterozygous glucocerebrosidase 1 mutations confer an increased risk for developing Parkinson disease. Current estimates indicate that 10 to 25% of Parkinson patients carry glucocerebrosidase 1 mutations. Ambroxol is a small molecule chaperone that has been shown to increase glucocerebrosidase activity in vitro. This study investigated the effect of ambroxol treatment on glucocerebrosidase activity and on α-synuclein and phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels in mice. Methods: Mice were treated with ambroxol for 12 days. After the treatment, glucocerebrosidase activity was measured in the mouse brain lysates. The brain lysates were also analyzed for α-synuclein and phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels. Results: Ambroxol treatment resulted in increased brain glucocerebrosidase activity in (1) wild-type mice, (2) transgenic mice expressing the heterozygous L444P mutation in the murine glucocerebrosidase 1 gene, and (3) transgenic mice overexpressing human α-synuclein. Furthermore, in the mice overexpressing human α-synuclein, ambroxol treatment decreased both α-synuclein and phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels. Interpretation: Our work supports the proposition that ambroxol should be further investigated as a potential novel disease-modifying therapy for treatment of Parkinson disease and neuronopathic Gaucher disease to increase glucocerebrosidase activity and decrease α-synuclein and phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels. Ann Neurol 2016;80:766–775.', 'Cerebral vasculitis of medium-sized vessels as a possible mechanism of brain damage in COVID-19 patients. Background and purpose: Cerebral complications related to COVID-19 were recently reported, and the underlying mechanisms of brain damage remain uncertain, probably multifactorial. Among various hypotheses suggested, a possible vasculitis was issued but never confirmed. Herein, we aimed to describe brain MRIs focused on the intracranial vessel wall in a population of COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations. Materials and methods: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 69 consecutive COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations underwent a brain MRI allowing the study of the intracranial vessel wall at Strasbourg University hospitals and were retrospectively included. During the same period, 25 consecutive patients, without suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, underwent a brain MRI urgently, with the same imaging protocols. A vasculitis seemed likely when imaging demonstrated vessel wall thickening with homogeneous and concentric enhancement. Results: Among the 69 COVID-19 patients included, 11 (16%) presented arterial vessel wall thickening with homogeneous and concentric enhancement, compatible with cerebral vasculitis. These neuroimaging findings were not found among the 25 patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Middle cerebral arteries, basilar artery, and posterior cerebral arteries were the most frequent vessels involved. For nine of them, imaging demonstrated ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion: Cerebral vasculitis of medium-sized vessels seems to be one of the mechanisms at the origin of brain damage related to COVID-19.', 'The impact of MEG source reconstruction method on source-space connectivity estimation: A comparison between minimum-norm solution and beamforming. Despite numerous important contributions, the investigation of brain connectivity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) still faces multiple challenges. One critical aspect of source-level connectivity, largely overlooked in the literature, is the putative effect of the choice of the inverse method on the subsequent cortico-cortical coupling analysis. We set out to investigate the impact of three inverse methods on source coherence detection using simulated MEG data. To this end, thousands of randomly located pairs of sources were created. Several parameters were manipulated, including inter- and intra-source correlation strength, source size and spatial configuration. The simulated pairs of sources were then used to generate sensor-level MEG measurements at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Next, the source level power and coherence maps were calculated using three methods (a) L2-Minimum-Norm Estimate (MNE), (b) Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming, and (c) Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) beamforming. The performances of the methods were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The results indicate that beamformers perform better than MNE for coherence reconstructions if the interacting cortical sources consist of point-like sources. On the other hand, MNE provides better connectivity estimation than beamformers, if the interacting sources are simulated as extended cortical patches, where each patch consists of dipoles with identical time series (high intra-patch coherence). However, the performance of the beamformers for interacting patches improves substantially if each patch of active cortex is simulated with only partly coherent time series (partial intra-patch coherence). These results demonstrate that the choice of the inverse method impacts the results of MEG source-space coherence analysis, and that the optimal choice of the inverse solution depends on the spatial and synchronization profile of the interacting cortical sources. The insights revealed here can guide method selection and help improve data interpretation regarding MEG connectivity estimation.', 'ASPP2 deficiency causes features of 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome. Chromosomal abnormalities are implicated in a substantial number of human developmental syndromes, but for many such disorders little is known about the causative genes. The recently described 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by characteristic dysmorphic features, intellectual disability and brain morphological abnormalities, but the precise genetic basis for these abnormalities remains unknown. Here, our detailed analysis of the genetic abnormalities of 1q41q42 microdeletion cases identified TP53BP2, which encodes apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2 (ASPP2), as a candidate gene for brain abnormalities. Consistent with this, Trp53bp2-deficient mice show dilation of lateral ventricles resembling the phenotype of 1q41q42 microdeletion patients. Trp53bp2 deficiency causes 100% neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6 background associated with a high incidence of neural tube defects and a range of developmental abnormalities such as congenital heart defects, coloboma, microphthalmia, urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities. Interestingly, abnormalities show a high degree of overlap with 1q41q42 microdeletion-Associated abnormalities. These findings identify TP53BP2 as a strong candidate causative gene for central nervous system (CNS) defects in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, and open new avenues for investigation of the mechanisms underlying CNS abnormalities.', 'Oxidative stress in aging brain: Nutritional and pharmacological interventions for neurodegenerative disorders. ', \"Associations of Omega-3 fatty acids with brain morphology and volume in cognitively healthy older adults: A narrative review. Introduction: Human neurodevelopment is complete by the 4th decade of life at which point brain atrophy ensues with variable rate and regionality into old age. Literally all regions of the brain experience atrophy with older age, however the pattern and rate of atrophy can dictate the behavioral consequences (i.e., cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease). Substantial research has aimed to discover the reasons why some people experience greater morphologic changes that produce undesirable consequences with aging and how it may be prevented. One possible explanation is diet, particularly fish consumption and the intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3) concentrated in fish oil. This narrative review examines the available evidence on the association between omega-3 and brain volume in non-demented older adults. Methods: A PubMed search of the literature was conducted in search of studies that investigated the associations of omega-3 on brain morphology and volume in cognitively intact older adults. Inclusion criteria were: populations of adults aged 45 years or over, who were cognitively intact, free of any central nervous system disease, and free of advanced structural brain atrophy. Study participants had to have DHA and EPA levels measured either by blood testing or scoring of dietary intake. There were no restrictions to dates of publication. Studies including demented participants, or participants with substantial white or grey matter atrophy visible on magnetic resonance imaging were excluded. Results and conclusion: The search identified only 12 studies, 8 of which were cross-sectional observational studies, 3 longitudinal observational studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial published between 2007 and 2019. The largest amount of evidence indicated that the hippocampus was most frequently involved in this association, with a higher volume associated with higher omega-3 levels. Larger total grey matter, total brain volume, and lower white matter lesion volume were also associated with higher omega-3 among four of the reviewed studies. However, most studies reviewed provided mixed findings regarding the presence or absence of the association of interest, and the findings were observed to be brain region-dependent. Current evidence is still insufficient to formulate recommendations for omega-3 intake to support brain health specifically.\", 'Dynamics of surface neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in glial cells: Single molecule insights. The surface dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, as well as ion channels, has been well-documented in neurons, revealing complex molecular behaviour and key physiological functions. However, our understanding of the membrane trafficking and dynamics of the signalling molecules located at the plasma membrane of glial cells is still in its infancy. Yet, recent breakthroughs in the field of glial cells have been obtained using combination of superresolution microscopy, single molecule imaging, and electrophysiological recordings. Here, we review our current knowledge on the surface dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors, transporters and ion channels, in glial cells. It has emerged that the brain cell network activity, synaptic activity, and calcium signalling, regulate the surface distribution and dynamics of these molecules. Remarkably, the dynamics of a given neurotransmitter receptor/transporter at the plasma membrane of a glial cell or neuron is unique, revealing the existence of cell-type specific regulatory pathways. Thus, investigating the dynamics of signalling proteins at the surface of glial cells will likely shed new light on our understanding of glial cell physiology and pathology.', 'In vivo online magnetic resonance quantification of absolute metabolite concentrations in microdialysate. In order to study metabolic processes in animal models of diseases and in patients, microdialysis probes have evolved as powerful tools that are minimally invasive. However, analyses of microdialysate, performed remotely, do not provide real-time monitoring of microdialysate composition. Microdialysate solutions can theoretically be analyzed online inside a preclicinal or clinical MRI scanner using MRS techniques. Due to low NMR sensitivity, acquisitions of real-time NMR spectra on very small solution volumes (μL) with low metabolite concentrations (mM range) represent a major issue. To address this challenge we introduce the approach of combining a microdialysis probe with a custom-built magnetic resonance microprobe that allows for online metabolic analysis (1H and 13C) with high sensitivity under continuous flow conditions. This system is mounted inside an MRI scanner and allows performing simultaneously MRI experiments and rapid MRS metabolic analysis of the microdialysate. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing extracellular brain cancer cells (glioma) in vitro and brain metabolites in an animal model in vivo. We expect that our approach is readily translatable into clinical settings and can be used for a better and precise understanding of diseases linked to metabolic dysfunction.', \"Rest Functional Brain Maturation during the First Year of Life. The first year of life is a key period of brain development, characterized by dramatic structural and functional modifications. Here, we measured rest cerebral blood flow (CBF) modifications throughout babies' first year of life using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging sequence in 52 infants, from 3 to 12 months of age. Overall, global rest CBF significantly increased during this age span. In addition, we found marked regional differences in local functional brain maturation. While primary sensorimotor cortices and insula showed early maturation, temporal and prefrontal region presented great rest CBF increase across the first year of life. Moreover, we highlighted a late and remarkably synchronous maturation of the prefrontal and posterior superior temporal cortices. These different patterns of regional cortical rest CBF modifications reflect a timetable of local functional brain maturation and are consistent with baby's cognitive development within the first year of life.\", 'Atlas55+: Brain Functional Atlas of Resting-State Networks for Late Adulthood. Currently, several human brain functional atlases are used to define the spatial constituents of the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the only brain atlases available are derived from samples of young adults. As brain networks are continuously reconfigured throughout life, the lack of brain atlases derived from older populations may influence RSN results in late adulthood. To address this gap, the aim of the study was to construct a reliable brain atlas derived only from older participants. We leveraged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from three cohorts of healthy older adults (total N = 563; age = 55-95 years) and a younger-adult cohort (N = 128; age = 18-35 years). We identified the major RSNs and their subdivisions across all older-adult cohorts. We demonstrated high spatial reproducibility of these RSNs with an average spatial overlap of 67%. Importantly, the RSNs derived from the older-adult cohorts were spatially different from those derived from the younger-adult cohort (P = 2.3 × 10-3). Lastly, we constructed a novel brain atlas, called Atlas55+, which includes the consensus of the major RSNs and their subdivisions across the older-adult cohorts. Thus, Atlas55+ provides a reliable age-appropriate template for RSNs in late adulthood and is publicly available. Our results confirm the need for age-appropriate functional atlases for studies investigating aging-related brain mechanisms.', 'Brain ultrasonography: methodology, basic and advanced principles and clinical applications. A narrative review. Brain ultrasonography can be used to evaluate cerebral anatomy and pathology, as well as cerebral circulation through analysis of blood flow velocities. Transcranial colour-coded duplex sonography is a generally safe, repeatable, non-invasive, bedside technique that has a strong potential in neurocritical care patients in many clinical scenarios, including traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest. Furthermore, the clinical applications of this technique may extend to different settings, including the general intensive care unit and the emergency department. Its increasing use reflects a growing interest in non-invasive cerebral and systemic assessment. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the basic and advanced principles underlying brain ultrasonography, and to review the different techniques and different clinical applications of this approach in the monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients.', \"Sulcal morphology in Alzheimer's disease: an effective marker of diagnosis and cognition. Measuring the morphology of brain sulci has been recently proposed as a novel imaging approach in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate the relevance of such an approach in AD, by exploring its (1) clinical relevance in comparison with traditional imaging methods, (2) relationship with amyloid deposition, (3) association with cognitive functions. Here, 51 patients (n = 32 mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia-AD, n = 19 moderate/severe dementia-AD) diagnosed according to clinical-biological criteria (CSF biomarkers and amyloid-PET) and 29 controls (with negative amyloid-PET) underwent neuropsychological and 3T-MRI examinations. Mean sulcal width (SW) and mean cortical thickness around the sulcus (CT-S) were automatically measured. We found higher SW and lower CT-S in patients with AD than in controls. These differences were more pronounced at later stages of the disease and provided the best diagnostic accuracies among the imaging markers. Correlations were not found between CT-S or SW and amyloid deposition but between specific cognitive functions and regional CT-S/SW in key associated regions. Sulcal morphology is a good supporting diagnosis tool that reflects the main cognitive impairments in AD. It could be considered as a good surrogate marker to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs.\", 'Clinical Relevance of Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases. ', \"Post-stroke deficit prediction from lesion and indirect structural and functional disconnection. Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient's lesion into an atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in all domains (0.16 5 R2 5 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 5 R2 5 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible (0.01 5 R2 5 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive disorders.\", 'Neuroprotective effects of pomegranate juice against parkinson’s disease and presence of ellagitannins-derived metabolite—urolithin A—in the brain. Pomegranate juice is a rich source of ellagitannins (ETs) believed to contribute to a wide range of pomegranate’s health benefits. While a lot of experimental studies have been devoted to Alzheimer disease and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, our knowledge of pomegranate’s effects against Parkinson’s disease (PD) is very limited. It is suggested that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by ETs-derived metabolites—urolithins. In this study, we examined the capability of pomegranate juice for protection against PD in a rat model of parkinsonism induced by rotenone. To evaluate its efficiency, assessment of postural instability, visualization of neurodegeneration, determination of oxidative damage to lipids and α-synuclein level, as well as markers of antioxidant defense status, inflammation, and apoptosis, were performed in the midbrain. We also check the presence of plausible active pomegranate ETs-derived metabolite, urolithin A, in the plasma and brain. Our results indicated that pomegranate juice treatment provided neuroprotection as evidenced by the postural stability improvement, enhancement of neuronal survival, its protection against oxidative damage and α-synuclein aggregation, the increase in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and maintenance of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein at the control level. In addition, we have provided evidence for the distribution of urolithin A to the brain.', 'Disruption of PHF21A causes syndromic intellectual disability with craniofacial anomalies, epilepsy, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems including autism. Background: PHF21A has been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies based on its deletion in the Potocki-Shaffer syndrome region at 11p11.2 and its disruption in three patients with balanced translocations. In addition, three patients with de novo truncating mutations in PHF21A were reported recently. Here, we analyze genomic data from seven unrelated individuals with mutations in PHF21A and provide detailed clinical descriptions, further expanding the phenotype associated with PHF21A haploinsufficiency. Methods: Diagnostic trio whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, use of GeneMatcher, targeted gene panel sequencing, and MiSeq sequencing techniques were used to identify and confirm variants. RT-qPCR was used to measure the normal expression pattern of PHF21A in multiple human tissues including 13 different brain tissues. Protein-DNA modeling was performed to substantiate the pathogenicity of the missense mutation. Results: We have identified seven heterozygous coding mutations, among which six are de novo (not maternal in one). Mutations include four frameshifts, one nonsense mutation in two patients, and one heterozygous missense mutation in the AT Hook domain, predicted to be deleterious and likely to cause loss of PHF21A function. We also found a new C-terminal domain composed of an intrinsically disordered region. This domain is truncated in six patients and thus likely to play an important role in the function of PHF21A, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the likely underlying mechanism in the phenotype of seven patients. Our results extend the phenotypic spectrum of PHF21A mutations by adding autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems. Furthermore, PHF21A is highly expressed in the human fetal brain, which is consistent with the neurodevelopmental phenotype. Conclusion: Deleterious nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations disrupting the AT Hook domain and/or an intrinsically disordered region in PHF21A were found to be associated with autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, tapering fingers, clinodactyly, and syndactyly, in addition to intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies. This suggests that PHF21A is involved in autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, and its haploinsufficiency causes a diverse neurological phenotype.', 'Spatial distribution of multiple sclerosis lesions in the cervical spinal cord. Spinal cord lesions detected on MRI hold important diagnostic and prognostic value for multiple sclerosis. Previous attempts to correlate lesion burden with clinical status have had limited success, however, suggesting that lesion location may be a contributor. Our aim was to explore the spatial distribution of multiple sclerosis lesions in the cervical spinal cord, with respect to clinical status. We included 642 suspected or confirmed multiple sclerosis patients (31 clinically isolated syndrome, and 416 relapsing-remitting, 84 secondary progressive, and 73 primary progressive multiple sclerosis) from 13 clinical sites. Cervical spine lesions were manually delineated on T 2 - and T 2 ∗-weighted axial and sagittal MRI scans acquired at 3 or 7 T. With an automatic publicly-available analysis pipeline we produced voxelwise lesion frequency maps to identify predilection sites in various patient groups characterized by clinical subtype, Expanded Disability Status Scale score and disease duration. We also measured absolute and normalized lesion volumes in several regions of interest using an atlas-based approach, and evaluated differences within and between groups. The lateral funiculi were more frequently affected by lesions in progressive subtypes than in relapsing in voxelwise analysis (P < 0.001), which was further confirmed by absolute and normalized lesion volumes (P < 0.01). The central cord area was more often affected by lesions in primary progressive than relapse-remitting patients (P < 0.001). Between white and grey matter, the absolute lesion volume in the white matter was greater than in the grey matter in all phenotypes (P < 0.001); however when normalizing by each region, normalized lesion volumes were comparable between white and grey matter in primary progressive patients. Lesions appearing in the lateral funiculi and central cord area were significantly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale score (P < 0.001). High lesion frequencies were observed in patients with a more aggressive disease course, rather than long disease duration. Lesions located in the lateral funiculi and central cord area of the cervical spine may influence clinical status in multiple sclerosis. This work shows the added value of cervical spine lesions, and provides an avenue for evaluating the distribution of spinal cord lesions in various patient groups.', 'Neuronal loss as evidenced by automated quantification of neuronal density following moderate and severe traumatic brain injury in rats. Traumatic brain injury causes widespread neurological lesions that can be reproduced in animals with the lateral fluid percussion (LFP) model. The characterization of the pattern of neuronal death generated in this model remains unclear, involving both cortical and subcortical brain regions. Here, 7 days after moderate (3 atmospheres absolute [ATA]) or severe (3.8 ATA) LFP, we estimated neuronal loss by using immunohistochemistry together with a computer-assisted automated method for quantifying neuronal density in brain sections. Neuronal counts were performed ipsilateral to the impact, in the parietal cortex ventral to the site of percussion, in the temporal cortex, in the dorsal thalamus, and in the hippocampus. These results were compared with the counts observed at similar areas in sham animals. We found that neuronal density was severely decreased in the temporal cortex (-60%), in the dorsal thalamus (-63%), and in area CA3 of the hippocampus (-36%) of injured animals compared with controls but was not significantly modified in the cortices located immediately ventral to the impact. Total cellular density increased in brain structures displaying neuronal death, suggesting the presence of gliosis. The increase in the severity of LFP did not change the pattern of neuronal injury. This automated method simplified the study of neuronal loss following traumatic brain injury and allowed the identification of a pattern of neuronal loss that spreads from the dorsal thalamus to the temporal cortex, with the most severe lesions being in brain structures remote from the site of impact.', 'Brain rhythms define distinct interaction networks with differential dependence on anatomy. Cognitive functions are subserved by rhythmic neuronal synchronization across widely distributed brain areas. In 105 area pairs, we investigated functional connectivity (FC) through coherence, power correlation, and Granger causality (GC) in the theta, beta, high-beta, and gamma rhythms. Between rhythms, spatial FC patterns were largely independent. Thus, the rhythms defined distinct interaction networks. Importantly, networks of coherence and GC were not explained by the spatial distributions of the strengths of the rhythms. Those networks, particularly the GC networks, contained clear modules, with typically one dominant rhythm per module. To understand how this distinctiveness and modularity arises on a common anatomical backbone, we correlated, across 91 area pairs, the metrics of functional interaction with those of anatomical projection strength. Anatomy was primarily related to coherence and GC, with the largest effect sizes for GC. The correlation differed markedly between rhythms, being less pronounced for the beta and strongest for the gamma rhythm.', 'Topographic distribution of brain iron deposition and small cerebrovascular lesions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: a post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging study with neuropathological correlates. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in 15% of the cases. A neuropathological continuity between ALS and FTLD-TDP is suspected. The present post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study compares the topographic distribution of iron (Fe) deposition and the incidence of small cerebrovascular lesions in ALS and in FTLD brains. Seventy-eight post-mortem brains underwent 7.0-tesla MRI. The patients consisted of 12 with ALS, 38 with FTLD, and 28 controls. Three ALS brains had minor FTLD features. Three coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere were submitted to T2 and T2* MRI sequences. The amount of Fe deposition in the deep brain structures and the number of small cerebrovascular lesions was determined in ALS and the subtypes of FTLD compared to control brains, with neuropathological correlates. A significant increase of Fe deposition was observed in the claustrum, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus of the FTLD-FUS and FTLD-TDP groups, while in the ALS one, the Fe increase was only observed in the caudate and the subthalamic nuclei. White matter changes were only significantly more severe in the FTLD compared to those in ALS and in controls brains. Cortical micro-bleeds were increased in the frontal and temporal lobes of FTLD as well as of ALS brains compared to controls. Cortical micro-infarcts were, on the other hand, more frequent in the control compared to the ALS and FTLD groups. The present study supports the assumption of a neuropathological continuity between ALS and FTLD and illustrates the favourable vascular risk profile in these diseases.', 'Tau, Diabetes and Insulin. Tau protein which was discovered in 1975 [310] became of great interest when it was identified as the main component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), a pathological feature in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [39, 110, 232]. Tau protein is expressed mainly in the brain as six isoforms generated by alternative splicing [46, 97]. Tau is a microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and plays a role in microtubules assembly and stability, as well as diverse cellular processes such as cell morphogenesis, cell division, and intracellular trafficking [49]. Additionally, Tau is involved in much larger neuronal functions particularly at the level of synapses and nuclei [11, 133, 280]. Tau is also physiologically released by neurons [233] even if the natural function of extracellular Tau remains to be uncovered (see other chapters of the present book).', 'Planning of Endocranial Supratentorial Basal Cistern and Skull Base Approaches Depending on Venous Patterns Using a Topogram. Background: Because damage or sacrifice of venous drainage during supratentorial basal cistern and skull base approaches may have severe and harmful consequences, methods to identify preoperatively veins at risk are of paramount importance. Among methods, a codified assessment with a venous topogram is helpful, with practical implications. Methods: This technical note describes how to construct an easy-to-use topogram. Three regions of interest are defined as triangles. The anterior triangle corresponds to the anterior frontal veins draining to the superior sagittal sinus at risk during anterior cerebral fossa surgery, the middle triangle corresponds to the anterior sylvian veins draining to the cavernous sinus at risk during pterional approaches, and the inferior triangle corresponds to the inferior cerebral veins draining to the transverse sinus at risk in subtemporal approaches and temporal lobe surgery. Results: Depending on predominance of the drainage, 4 situations were defined: an anterior, an inferior, and a middle predominance or equilibrium between the 3 triangles. These anatomic features have important practical implications in skull base and basal cistern approaches. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the only topogram described in the scientific literature. Any well-defined approach should be adapted to the individual patient according not only to location and type of lesion but also to the venous drainage to be encountered along the way.', 'Not a single but multiple populations of GABAergic neurons control sleep. The role of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in sleep induction and maintenance is well accepted since most insomnia treatments target GABAa receptors. However, the population(s) of GABAergic neurons involved in the beneficial effect of GABA on sleep remains to be identified. This is not an easy task since GABAergic neurons are widely distributed in all brain structures. A recently growing number of populations of GABAergic neurons have been involved in sleep control. We first review here possible candidates for inducing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep including the GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic area, the parafacial zone in the brainstem, the nucleus accumbens and the cortex. We also discuss the role of several populations of GABAergic neurons in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep control. Indeed, it is well accepted that muscle atonia occurring during REM sleep is due to a GABA/glycinergic hyperpolarization of motoneurons. Recent evidence strongly suggests that these neurons are located in the ventral medullary reticular formation. It has also recently been shown that neurons containing the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone and GABA located in the lateral hypothalamic area control REM sleep expression. Finally, a population of REM-off GABAergic neurons located in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray has been shown to gate REM sleep by inhibiting glutamatergic neurons located in the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In summary, recent data clearly indicate that multiple populations of GABAergic neurons located throughout the brain from the cortex to the medulla oblongata control NREM and REM sleep.', 'Diffusion MRI data, sulcal anatomy, and tractography for eight species from the Primate Brain Bank. Large-scale comparative neuroscience requires data from many species and, ideally, at multiple levels of description. Here, we contribute to this endeavor by presenting diffusion and structural MRI data from eight primate species that have not or rarely been described in the literature. The selected samples from the Primate Brain Bank cover a prosimian, New and Old World monkeys, and a great ape. We present preliminary labelling of the cortical sulci and tractography of the optic radiation, dorsal part of the cingulum bundle, and dorsal parietal–frontal and ventral temporal-frontal longitudinal white matter tracts. Both dorsal and ventral association fiber systems could be observed in all samples, with the dorsal tracts occupying much less relative volume in the prosimian than in other species. We discuss the results in the context of known primate specializations and present hypotheses for further research. All data and results presented here are available online as a resource for the scientific community.', \"Aging and cerebrovascular lesions in pure and in mixed neurodegenerative and vascular dementia brains: A neuropathological study. Introduction: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in our aging population. Because of the complexity of disease pathology, dementia classifications remain controversial. The present post-mortem study investigates whether there are age differences between dementia brains with a single pure neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease and those with mixed pathological features. Also, the impact of these vascular lesions is compared. Material and methods: A total of 132 dementia brains with a pure neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease and 84 with mixed features were examined. Main age and gender distribution were compared between the overall group of pure and of mixed dementia. Also, the most common subgroups were compared separately. In addition to the detection of macroscopic visible lesions, a whole coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere, at the level of the mamillary body, was taken for semi-quantitative microscopic evaluation of white matter changes (WMCs), cortical micro-bleeds (CoMBs), and cortical micro-infarcts (CoMIs). Results: Overall, patients with mixed dementia were at death significantly older than those with pure dementia. According to the main diagnosis, the pure forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) were more common in the younger age groups while in the older ones the mixed form of Lewy body disease (LBD) predominated. Neuropathological examination revealed an increased severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), territorial infarcts, lobar haematomas, and CoMIs in the mixed AD group. In FTLD only CoMIs were increased in the mixed group, while in LBD no differences in severity of all cerebrovascular lesions were observed. Lacunar infarcts were more frequent in pure vascular dementia, while CAA predominated in the mixed one. Conclusions: Mixed dementia during the aging process is mainly due to the severity of AD and LBD pathologies combined with CAA-related cerebrovascular lesions.\", 'Case report: Hemianopia: from suspected glioblastoma to the diagnosis of ectopic schistosomiasis haematobium infection in a traveler eturning from the republic of the congo.

Despite extensive efforts in recent years, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant obstacle for drug delivery. This study proposes using a clinical extracorporeal shockwave instrument to open the BBB, combined with a laser assisted bi-axial locating platform to achieve non-invasive, controllable-focus and reversible BBB opening in the brains of rats. Under shockwave treatment with an intensity level of 5 (P-9.79 MPa, energy flux density (EFD) 0.21 mJ/mm2) and a pulse repetition frequency of 5 Hz, the BBB could be opened after 50 shocks without the use of an ultrasound contrast agent. With the proposed method, the BBB opening can be precisely controlled in terms of depth, size and location. Moreover, a shockwave based gene transfection was demonstrated using a luciferase gene.', 'Could non-invasive brain stimulation help treat dysarthria? A single-case study. ', 'Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Mortality after Convexity Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy. Background and Purpose - Convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is an increasingly recognized presentation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), usually revealed by transient symptoms, but data on its outcome are limited. We compared the risk of future intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), cSAH, and death in patients with CAA after cSAH and after lobar ICH. Methods - Consecutive patients with probable CAA, based on the Boston criteria, presenting with cSAH (CAA-cSAH) or lobar ICH (CAA-ICH) were included. We obtained baseline clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data and follow-up information. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare incidence rate for symptomatic ICH, symptomatic cSAH, and late-death (beyond 30 days) between patients with CAA-cSAH and CAA-ICH. Results - Among 105 patients (mean age, 76.7±7.5 years) enrolled, 44 participants presented with CAA-cSAH and 61 with CAA-ICH. The median follow-up was 22.2 months (interquartile range, 12.6-34.4). The symptomatic ICH rate (per person-year) was 10.5% (95% CI, 5.6-19.4) in patients with CAA-cSAH compared with 8.5% (95% CI, 4.4-16.4) in those with CAA-ICH (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.32-3.43). The annual incidence rates of symptomatic cSAH (9.9% versus 3.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.43-7.28) and death (9.5% versus 17.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.22-1.43) were not significantly different between patients with CAA-cSAH and those with CAA-ICH. Conclusions - Patients with CAA-related cSAH have a poor outcome, with similar high risk of future ICH and long-term mortality than CAA patients after lobar ICH. Our findings may have important prognostic implication and guide management of patients with cSAH in CAA.', \"Nav1.1-Overexpressing Interneuron Transplants Restore Brain Rhythms and Cognition in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease. Inhibitory interneurons regulate the oscillatory rhythms and network synchrony that are required for cognitive functions and disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network dysrhythmias in AD and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with hypofunction of Nav1.1, a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit predominantly expressed in interneurons. We show that Nav1.1-overexpressing, but not wild-type, interneuron transplants derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) enhance behavior-dependent gamma oscillatory activity, reduce network hypersynchrony, and improve cognitive functions in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP)-transgenic mice, which simulate key aspects of AD. Increased Nav1.1 levels accelerated action potential kinetics of transplanted fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking interneurons. Nav1.1-deficient interneuron transplants were sufficient to cause behavioral abnormalities in wild-type mice. We conclude that the efficacy of interneuron transplantation and the function of transplanted cells in an AD-relevant context depend on their Nav1.1 levels. Disease-specific molecular optimization of cell transplants may be required to ensure therapeutic benefits in different conditions. Inhibitory interneurons regulate brain rhythms and cognitive functions disrupted by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Martinez-Losa et al. show that the level of the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1 in interneuron transplants regulates their therapeutic efficacy in an AD mouse model.\", \"Neuronal sphingosine kinase 2 subcellular localization is altered in Alzheimer's disease brain. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accompanied by neuronal loss. Aβ accumulation has been associated with an impaired sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism. S1P is generated by sphingosine kinases (SphKs), of which there are two isoenzymes SphK1 and SphK2, and degraded by the sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SPL). We previously reported, that both a decrease in SphK1 expression and an increase in SPL expression, correlated with amyloid deposits in the entorhinal cortex of AD brains, suggesting a global loss of pro-survival S1P in AD neurons. SphK2 contribution has also been examined in AD yielding to conflicting results that may reflect the complexity of SphK2 regulation. The subcellular localization of SphK2, hence the compartmentalization of generated S1P, is recognized to play a crucial role in dictating either its pro-survival or pro-apoptotic functions. We therefore aimed at studying the expression of SphK2 and notably its subcellular localization in brain tissues from patients with AD. RESULTS: We report that a decrease in SphK2 protein cytosolic expression correlated with the density of amyloid deposits in a cohort of 25 post-mortem brains. Interestingly, we observed that the equilibrium between cytoplasmic and nuclear SphK2 is disrupted and showed that SphK2 is preferentially localized in the nucleus in AD brain extracts as compared to control extracts, with a marked increase of cleaved SphK2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a shift in the subcellular localization of the S1P generating SphK2 may compromise the well established pro-survival cytosolic S1P by favoring the production of nuclear S1P associated with adverse effects in AD pathogenesis.\", 'Effect of In-Hospital Remote Ischemic Perconditioning on Brain Infarction Growth and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: The RESCUE BRAIN Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning has been reported to reduce brain infarction volume in animal models of stroke. Whether this neuroprotective effect was observed in patients with acute ischemic stroke remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning administered to the leg of patients with acute ischemic stroke can reduce brain infarction volume growth. Design, Setting, and Participants: This proof-of-concept multicenter prospective randomized open-label with blinded end point clinical trial was performed from January 12, 2015, to May 2, 2018. Patients were recruited from 11 stroke centers in France. Of the 188 patients who received magnetic resonance imaging within 6 hours of symptom onset and were confirmed to have carotid ischemic stroke, 93 were randomized to receive treatment with lower-limb remote ischemic perconditioning in addition to standard care (the intervention group), and 95 were randomized to receive standard care alone (the control group). Interventions: Randomization on a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning (4 cycles of 5-minute inflations and 5-minute deflations to the thigh to 110 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure) in addition to standard care or standard care alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The change in brain infarction volume growth between baseline and 24 hours, measured by a diffusion-weighted sequence of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. Results: A total of 188 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.2 [15.7] years; 98 men [52.1%]) were included in this intention-to-treat analysis. At hospital admission, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-16) and the median brain infarction volume was 11.4 cm3 (IQR, 3.6-35.8 cm3); 164 patients (87.2%) received intravenous thrombolysis, and 64 patients (34.0%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The median increase in brain infarction growth was 0.30 cm3 (IQR, 0.11-0.48 cm3) in the intervention group and 0.37 cm3 (IQR, 0.19-0.55 cm3) in the control group (mean between-group difference on loge-transformed change, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.33 to 0.18; P =.57). An excellent outcome (defined as a score of 0-1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale or a score equal to the prestroke modified Rankin Scale score) was observed in 46 of 90 patients (51.1%) in the intervention group and 37 of 91 patients (40.7%) in the control group (P =.12). No significant differences in 90-day mortality were observed between the intervention and control groups (14 of 90 patients; Kaplan-Meier estimate, 15.8% vs 10 of 91 patients; Kaplan-Meier estimate, 10.4%, respectively; P =.45) or with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (4 of 88 patients [4.5%] in both groups; P =.97). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning, during or after reperfusion therapies, had no significant effect on brain infarction volume growth at 24 hours after symptom onset. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02189928.', 'Role of the GLUT1 Glucose Transporter in Postnatal CNS Angiogenesis and Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity. Rationale: Endothelial cells (ECs) are highly glycolytic and generate the majority of their energy via the breakdown of glucose to lactate. At the same time, a main role of ECs is to allow the transport of glucose to the surrounding tissues. GLUT1 (glucose transporter isoform 1/Slc2a1) is highly expressed in ECs of the central nervous system (CNS) and is often implicated in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, but whether and how GLUT1 controls EC metabolism and function is poorly understood. Objective: We evaluated the role of GLUT1 in endothelial metabolism and function during postnatal CNS development as well as at the adult BBB. Methods and Results: Inhibition of GLUT1 decreases EC glucose uptake and glycolysis, leading to energy depletion and the activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), and decreases EC proliferation without affecting migration. Deletion of GLUT1 from the developing postnatal retinal endothelium reduces retinal EC proliferation and lowers vascular outgrowth, without affecting the number of tip cells. In contrast, in the brain, we observed a lower number of tip cells in addition to reduced brain EC proliferation, indicating that within the CNS, organotypic differences in EC metabolism exist. Interestingly, when ECs become quiescent, endothelial glycolysis is repressed, and GLUT1 expression increases in a Notch-dependent fashion. GLUT1 deletion from quiescent adult ECs leads to severe seizures, accompanied by neuronal loss and CNS inflammation. Strikingly, this does not coincide with BBB leakiness, altered expression of genes crucial for BBB barrier functioning nor reduced vascular function. Instead, we found a selective activation of inflammatory and extracellular matrix related gene sets. Conclusions: GLUT1 is the main glucose transporter in ECs and becomes uncoupled from glycolysis during quiescence in a Notch-dependent manner. It is crucial for developmental CNS angiogenesis and adult CNS homeostasis but does not affect BBB barrier function.', 'Replicability and impact of statistics in the detection of neural responses of consciousness. ', 'TGFB1-mediated gliosis in multiple sclerosis spinal cords is favored by the regionalized expression of HOXA5 and the age-dependent decline in androgen receptor ligands. In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a progressive form of the disease, spinal cord (SC) functions slowly deteriorate beyond age 40. We previously showed that in the SC of these patients, large areas of incomplete demyelination extend distance away from plaque borders and are characterized by a unique progliotic TGFB1 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1) genomic signature. Here, we attempted to determine whether region-and age-specific physiological parameters could promote the progression of SC periplaques in MS patients beyond age 40. An analysis of transcriptomics databases showed that, under physiological conditions, a set of 10 homeobox (HOX) genes are highly significantly overexpressed in the human SC as compared to distinct brain regions. Among these HOX genes, a survey of the human proteome showed that only HOXA5 encodes a protein which interacts with a member of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, namely SMAD1 (SMAD family member 1). Moreover, HOXA5 was previously found to promote the TGF-beta pathway. Interestingly, SMAD1 is also a protein partner of the androgen receptor (AR) and an unsupervised analysis of gene ontology terms indicates that the AR pathway antagonizes the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway. Retrieval of promoter analysis data further confirmed that AR negatively regulates the transcription of several members of the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway. On this basis, we propose that in progressive MS patients, the physiological SC overexpression of HOXA5 combined with the age-dependent decline in AR ligands may favor the slow progression of TGFB1-mediated gliosis. Potential therapeutic implications are discussed.', 'Roles of oestradiol receptor alpha and beta against hypertension and brain mitochondrial dysfunction under intermittent hypoxia in female rats. Aim: Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) induces systemic (hypertension) and central alterations (mitochondrial dysfunction underlying cognitive deficits). We hypothesized that agonists of oestradiol receptors (ER) α and β prevent CIH-induced hypertension and brain mitochondrial dysfunction. Methods: Ovariectomized female rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle (Veh), the ERα agonist propylpyraoletriol (PPT — 30\\xa0μg/kg/day) or the ERβ agonist diarylpropionitril (DPN — 100\\xa0μg/kg/day). Animals were exposed to CIH (21%-10% F I O 2 — 10 cycles/hour – 8\\xa0hours/day – 7\\xa0days) or normoxia. Arterial blood pressure was measured after CIH or normoxia exposures. Mitochondrial respiration and H 2 O 2 production were measured in brain cortex with high-resolution respirometry, as well as activity of complex I and IV of the electron transport chain, citrate synthase, pyruvate, and lactate dehydrogenase (PDH and LDH). Results: Propylpyraoletriol but not DPN prevented the rise of arterial pressure induced by CIH. CIH exposures decreased O 2 consumption, complex I activity, and increased H 2 O 2 production. CIH had no effect on citrate synthase activity, but decreased PDH activity and increased LDH activity indicating higher anaerobic glycolysis. Propylpyraoletriol and DPN treatments prevented all these alterations. Conclusions: We conclude that in OVX female rats, the ERα agonist prevents from CIH-induced hypertension while both ERα and ERβ agonists prevent the brain mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic switch induced by CIH. These findings may have implications for menopausal women suffering of sleep apnoea regarding hormonal therapy.', 'Altered hypermetabolic response to cortical spreading depolarizations after traumatic brain injury in rats. Spreading depolarizations are waves of near-complete breakdown of neuronal transmembrane ion gradients, free energy starving, and mass depolarization. Spreading depolarizations in electrically inactive tissue are associated with poor outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. Here, we studied changes in regional cerebral blood flow and brain oxygen (PbtO2), glucose ([Glc]b), and lactate ([Lac]b) concentrations in rats, using minimally invasive real-time sensors. Rats underwent either spreading depolarizations chemically triggered by KCl in naïve cortex in absence of traumatic brain injury or spontaneous spreading depolarizations in the traumatic penumbra after traumatic brain injury, or a cluster of spreading depolarizations triggered chemically by KCl in a remote window from which spreading depolarizations invaded penumbral tissue. Spreading depolarizations in noninjured cortex induced a hypermetabolic response characterized by a decline in [Glc]b and monophasic increases in regional cerebral blood flow, PbtO2, and [Lac]b, indicating transient hyperglycolysis. Following traumatic brain injury, spontaneous spreading depolarizations occurred, causing further decline in [Glc]b and reducing the increase in regional cerebral blood flow and biphasic responses of PbtO2 and [Lac]b, followed by prolonged decline. Recovery of PbtO2 and [Lac]b was significantly delayed in traumatized animals. Prespreading depolarization [Glc]b levels determined the metabolic response to clusters. The results suggest a compromised hypermetabolic response to spreading depolarizations and slower return to physiological conditions following traumatic brain injury-induced spreading depolarizations.', 'Effects of bisphenol S, a major substitute of bisphenol A, on neurobehavioral responses and cerebral monocarboxylate transporters expression in mice. Bisphenol A has been restricted in a large variety of products. Bisphenol S (BPS) is its major substitute. Yet, the impacts of BPS on the central nervous system are unknown, especially in vulnerable populations like children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BPS on behavioral performances and the expression of cerebral monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Male Swiss mice were exposed to BPS at 100 μg/kg in drinking water for 10 weeks. The protocol started after the lactation period, which is a sensitive period of early social-emotional development. Elevated T-maze and open field tests were used to measure respectively, anxiety-related and activity-related behaviors. Molecular expressions of MCTs isoforms (MCT1, MCT2, MCT4) were determined in the frontal cortex. Data showed that BPS does not affect mRNA expression of MCTs. However, BPS decreases the number of entries into the open arms and the time spent on them for BPS-treated mice. These data reveal an anxiogenic effect of BPS. For locomotor activity and exploratory behavior levels, differences did not reach a statistically significant level in the BPS-exposed group. The effect of BPS on behavioral performances unravels a putative risk for psychopathology development in early childhood and calls for more attention.', 'Large-scale comparative neuroimaging: Where are we and what do we need?. Neuroimaging has a lot to offer comparative neuroscience. Although invasive “gold standard” techniques have a better spatial resolution, neuroimaging allows fast, whole-brain, repeatable, and multi-modal measurements of structure and function in living animals and post-mortem tissue. In the past years, comparative neuroimaging has increased in popularity. However, we argue that its most significant potential lies in its ability to collect large-scale datasets of many species to investigate principles of variability in brain organisation across whole orders of species—an ambition that is presently unfulfilled but achievable. We briefly review the current state of the field and explore what the current obstacles to such an approach are. We propose some calls to action.', \"AxTract: Toward microstructure informed tractography. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography has become the tool of choice to probe the human brain's white matter in vivo. However, tractography algorithms produce a large number of erroneous streamlines (false positives), largely due to complex ambiguous tissue configurations. Moreover, the relationship between the resulting streamlines and the underlying white matter microstructure characteristics remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a new approach to simultaneously reconstruct white matter fascicles and characterize the apparent distribution of axon diameters within fascicles. To achieve this, our method, AxTract, takes full advantage of the recent development DW-MRI microstructure acquisition, modeling, and reconstruction techniques. This enables AxTract to separate parallel fascicles with different microstructure characteristics, hence reducing ambiguities in areas of complex tissue configuration. We report a decrease in the incidence of erroneous streamlines compared to the conventional deterministic tractography algorithms on simulated data. We also report an average increase in streamline density over 15 known fascicles of the 34 healthy subjects. Our results suggest that microstructure information improves tractography in crossing areas of the white matter. Moreover, AxTract provides additional microstructure information along the fascicle that can be studied alongside other streamline-based indices. Overall, AxTract provides the means to distinguish and follow white matter fascicles using their microstructure characteristics, bringing new insights into the white matter organization. This is a step forward in microstructure informed tractography, paving the way to a new generation of algorithms able to deal with intricate configurations of white matter fibers and providing quantitative brain connectivity analysis.

Background In spite of the number of applications describing the use of MALDI MSI, one of its major drawbacks is the limited capability of identifying multiple compound classes directly on the same tissue section. Methods We demonstrate the use of grid-aided, parafilm-assisted microdissection to perform MALDI MS imaging and shotgun proteomics and metabolomics in a combined workflow and using only a single tissue section. The grid is generated by microspotting acid dye 25 using a piezoelectric microspotter, and this grid was used as a guide to locate regions of interest and as an aid during manual microdissection. Subjecting the dissected pieces to the modified Folch method allows to separate the metabolites from proteins. The proteins can then be subjected to digestion under controlled conditions to improve protein identification yields. Results The proof of concept experiment on rat brain generated 162 and 140 metabolite assignments from three ROIs (cerebellum, hippocampus and midbrain/hypothalamus) in positive and negative modes, respectively, and 890, 1303 and 1059 unique proteins. Integrated metabolite and protein overrepresentation analysis identified pathways associated with the biological functions of each ROI, most of which were not identified when looking at the protein and metabolite lists individually. Conclusions This combined MALDI MS imaging and multi-omics approach further extends the amount of information that can be generated from single tissue sections. General significance To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report combining both imaging and multi-omics analyses in the same workflow and on the same tissue section.', 'Brain hemorrhage recurrence, small vessel disease type, and cerebral microbleeds: A meta-analysis. Objective: We evaluated recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk in ICH survivors, stratified by the presence, distribution, and number of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on MRI (i.e., the presumed causal underlying small vessel disease and its severity). Methods: This was a meta-analysis of prospective cohorts following ICH, with blood-sensitive brain MRI soon after ICH. We estimated annualized recurrent symptomatic ICH rates for each study and compared pooled odds ratios (ORs) of recurrent ICH by CMB presence/absence and presumed etiology based on CMB distribution (strictly lobar CMBs related to probable or possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA] vs non-CAA) and burden (1, 2-4, 5-10, and >10 CMBs), using random effects models. Results: We pooled data from 10 studies including 1,306 patients: 325 with CAA-related and 981 CAA-unrelated ICH. The annual recurrent ICH risk was higher in CAA-related ICH vs CAA-unrelated ICH (7.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2-12.6 vs 1.1%, 95% CI 0.5-1.7 per year, respectively; p = 0.01). In CAA-related ICH, multiple baseline CMBs (versus none) were associated with ICH recurrence during follow-up (range 1-3 years): OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.8; p = 0.006), 4.3 (95% CI 1.8-10.3; p = 0.001), and 3.4 (95% CI 1.4-8.3; p = 0.007) for 2-4, 5-10, and >10 CMBs, respectively. In CAA-unrelated ICH, only >10 CMBs (versus none) were associated with recurrent ICH (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.1-15; p = 0.001). The presence of 1 CMB (versus none) was not associated with recurrent ICH in CAA-related or CAA-unrelated cohorts. Conclusions: CMB burden and distribution on MRI identify subgroups of ICH survivors with higher ICH recurrence risk, which may help to predict ICH prognosis with relevance for clinical practice and treatment trials.', 'Electrophysiological technical procedures. The reliability of the interpretation of SEEG data depends entirely on the technical quality of the acquisition recording. Digitalization of data and the development of computer technology, over the last 20 years have transformed electrophysiological procedures. Recording equipment must be able to record concomitantly clinical events and brain electrical activity. Recording is carried out during wakefulness and sleep and with use of various activation methods (hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation). Intracerebral electrical stimulations (with low and high frequency) and the acquisition of evoked potentials complete the SEEG exploration. This chapter will discuss the characteristics of video-EEG recording equipment, procedures for acquisition and creation of SEEG montages, technical recording and activations, procedures of intracerebral electrical stimulations and the acquisition of evoked potentials.', 'Iron and Neurodevelopment. In the central nervous system, iron is a cofactor of many metabolic processes and synthesis of aminergic neurotransmitters. Iron plays an major function on brain development from the prenatal period to teenage years. The blood-brain barrier modulates concentration of iron in the brain. In case of iron deficiency in the child, the negative impact on the myelinogenesis and synaptogenesis are well proven, with negative effects on psychomotor and cognitive functions. Iron supplementation has a beneficial effect, even if there is no anemia. The consequences of iron deficiency are more harmful as deficiency is early. The main mechanisms involved about iron and brain are reviewed.', 'Nucleus Basalis of Meynert Stimulation for Lewy Body Dementia: A Phase I Randomized Clinical Trial. OBJECTIVES: Nucleus basalis of Meynert deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) has been proposed for patients with dementia. Here, we aim to assess the safety and effects of NBM-DBS in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD), in a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial. METHODS: Six patients with mild to moderate LBD (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [7.8] years) were included, operated on for bilateral NBM-DBS, and assigned to receive either active or sham NBM-DBS followed by the opposite condition for 3 months. The primary outcome was the difference in the total free recalls of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) between active and sham NBM-DBS. Secondary outcomes were assessments of the safety and effects of NBM-DBS on cognition, motor disability, sleep, and PET imaging. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the FCSRT score with active vs sham NBM-DBS. The surgical procedures were well tolerated in all patients, but we observed significant decreases in Stroop and Benton scores after electrode implantation. We observed no significant difference in other scales between active and sham NBM-DBS. With active NBM-DBS relative to baseline, phonemic fluency and motor disability significantly decreased. Lastly, the superior lingual gyrus metabolic activity significantly increased with active NBM-DBS. CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS does not appear to be totally safe for patients with LBD with no evidence of cognitive benefit. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01340001. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that, for patients with LBD operated on for bilateral NBM-DBS, active NBM-DBS stimulation compared to sham stimulation did not significantly change selective recall scores.', 'Expanding the KIF4A-associated phenotype. Kinesin super family (KIF) genes encode motor kinesins, a family of evolutionary conserved proteins, involved in intracellular trafficking of various cargoes. These proteins are critical for various physiological processes including neuron function and survival, ciliary function and ciliogenesis, and cell-cycle progression. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in motor kinesin genes can lead to a variety of human diseases, including monogenic disorders. Neuropathies, impaired higher brain functions, structural brain abnormalities and multiple congenital anomalies (i.e., renal, urogenital, and limb anomalies) can result from pathogenic variants in many KIF genes. We expand the phenotype associated with KIF4A variants from developmental delay and intellectual disability with or without epilepsy to a congenital anomaly phenotype with hydrocephalus and various brain anomalies at the more severe end of phenotypic manifestations. Additional anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, congenital lymphedema, eye, and dental anomalies seem to be variably associated and overlap with clinical signs observed in other kinesinopathies. Caution still applies to missense variants, but hopefully, future work will further establish genotype–phenotype correlations in a larger number of patients and functional studies may give further insights into the complex function of KIF4A.', 'Prescreening for European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia (EPAD) trial-ready cohort: Impact of AD risk factors and recruitment settings. Background: Recruitment is often a bottleneck in secondary prevention trials in Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, screen-failure rates in these trials are typically high due to relatively low prevalence of AD pathology in individuals without dementia, especially among cognitively unimpaired. Prescreening on AD risk factors may facilitate recruitment, but the efficiency will depend on how these factors link to participation rates and AD pathology. We investigated whether common AD-related factors predict trial-ready cohort participation and amyloid status across different prescreen settings. Methods: We monitored the prescreening in four cohorts linked to the European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia (EPAD) Registry (n = 16,877; mean ± SD age = 64 ± 8 years). These included a clinical cohort, a research in-person cohort, a research online cohort, and a population-based cohort. Individuals were asked to participate in the EPAD longitudinal cohort study (EPAD-LCS), which serves as a trial-ready cohort for secondary prevention trials. Amyloid positivity was measured in cerebrospinal fluid as part of the EPAD-LCS assessment. We calculated participation rates and numbers needed to prescreen (NNPS) per participant that was amyloid-positive. We tested if age, sex, education level, APOE status, family history for dementia, memory complaints or memory scores, previously collected in these cohorts, could predict participation and amyloid status. Results: A total of 2595 participants were contacted for participation in the EPAD-LCS. Participation rates varied by setting between 3 and 59%. The NNPS were 6.9 (clinical cohort), 7.5 (research in-person cohort), 8.4 (research online cohort), and 88.5 (population-based cohort). Participation in the EPAD-LCS (n = 413 (16%)) was associated with lower age (odds ratio (OR) age = 0.97 [0.95-0.99]), high education (OR = 1.64 [1.23-2.17]), male sex (OR = 1.56 [1.19-2.04]), and positive family history of dementia (OR = 1.66 [1.19-2.31]). Among participants in the EPAD-LCS, amyloid positivity (33%) was associated with higher age (OR = 1.06 [1.02-1.10]) and APOE ϵ4 allele carriership (OR = 2.99 [1.81-4.94]). These results were similar across prescreen settings. Conclusions: Numbers needed to prescreen varied greatly between settings. Understanding how common AD risk factors link to study participation and amyloid positivity is informative for recruitment strategy of studies on secondary prevention of AD.', 'Memory scrutinized through electrical brain stimulation: A review of 80 years of experiential phenomena. Electrical brain stimulations (EBS) sometimes induce reminiscences, but it is largely unknown what type of memories they can trigger. We reviewed 80 years of literature on reminiscences induced by EBS and added our own database. We classified them according to modern conceptions of memory. We observed a surprisingly large variety of reminiscences covering all aspects of declarative memory. However, most were poorly detailed and only a few were episodic. This result does not support theories of a highly stable and detailed memory, as initially postulated, and still widely believed as true by the general public. Moreover, memory networks could only be activated by some of their nodes: 94.1% of EBS were temporal, although the parietal and frontal lobes, also involved in memory networks, were stimulated. The qualitative nature of memories largely depended on the site of stimulation: EBS to rhinal cortex mostly induced personal semantic reminiscences, while only hippocampal EBS induced episodic memories. This result supports the view that EBS can activate memory in predictable ways in humans.', 'A genome-wide association study in multiple system atrophy. Objective: To identify genetic variants that play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy (MSA), we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Methods: We performed a GWAS with >5 million genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 918 patients with MSA of European ancestry and 3,864 controls. MSA cases were collected from North American and European centers, one third of which were neuropathologically confirmed. Results: We found no significant loci after stringent multiple testing correction. A number of regions emerged as potentially interesting for follow-up at p < 1 × 10-6, including SNPs in the genes FBXO47, ELOVL7, EDN1, and MAPT. Contrary to previous reports, we found no association of the genes SNCA and COQ2 with MSA. Conclusions: We present a GWAS in MSA. We have identified several potentially interesting gene loci, including the MAPT locus, whose significance will have to be evaluated in a larger sample set. Common genetic variation in SNCA and COQ2 does not seem to be associated with MSA. In the future, additional samples of well-characterized patients with MSA will need to be collected to perform a larger MSA GWAS, but this initial study forms the basis for these next steps.', 'Early cerebrovascular and long-term neurological modifications ensue following juvenile mild traumatic brain injury in male mice. Clinical evidence suggests that a mild traumatic brain injury occurring at a juvenile age (jmTBI) may be sufficient to elicit pathophysiological modifications. However, clinical reports are not adequately integrated with experimental studies examining brain changes occurring post-jmTBI. We We monitored the cerebrovascular modifications and assessed the long-term behavioral and electrographic changes re resulting from experimental jmTBI. In vivo photoacoustic imaging demonstrated a decrease of cerebrovascular oxygen saturation levels in the impacted area occurying hours post-jmTBI. Three days post-jmTBI oxygenation returned to pre-jmTBI levels, stabilizing at 7 and 30 days after the injury. At the functional level, cortical arterioles displayed no NMDA vasodilation response, while vasoconstriction induced by thromboxane receptor agonist was enhanced at 1 day post-jmTBI. Arterioles showed abnormal NMDA vasodilation at 3 days post-jmTBI, returning to normality at 7 days post injury. Histology showed changes in vessel diameters from 1 to 30 days post-jmTBI. Neurological evaluation indicated signs of anxiety-like behavior up to 30 days post-jmTBI. EEG recordings performed at the cortical site of impact 30 days post-jmTBI did not indicate seizures activity, although it revealed a reduction of gamma waves as compared to age matched sham. Histology showed decrease of neuronal filament staining. In conclusion, experimental jmTBI triggers an early cerebrovascular hypo‑oxygenation in vivo and faulty vascular reactivity. The exact topographical coherence and the direct casualty between early cerebrovascular changes and the observed long-term neurological modifications remain to be investigated. A potential translational value for cerebrovascular oxygen monitoring in jmTBI is discussed.', 'Are hallucinations due to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory influences on the brain?. This review from the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research intends to question the pertinence of the excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis as a model for hallucinations. A large number of studies suggest that subtle impairments of the E/I balance are involved in neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. Emerging evidence also points to a role of the E/I balance in maintaining stable perceptual representations, suggesting it may be a plausible model for hallucinations. In support, hallucinations have been linked to inhibitory deficits as shown with impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor plasticity, reductions in gamma-frequency oscillations, hyperactivity in sensory cortices, and cognitive inhibition deficits. However, the mechanisms by which E/I dysfunctions at the cellular level might relate to clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits remain unclear. Given recent data advances in the field of clinical neuroscience, it is now possible to conduct a synthesis of available data specifically related to hallucinations. These findings are integrated with the latest computational frameworks of hallucinations, and recommendations for future research are provided.', \"In vivo biased agonism at 5-HT <inf>1A</inf> receptors: characterisation by simultaneous PET/MR imaging. In neuropharmacology, the recent concept of 'biased agonism' denotes the capacity of certain agonists to target-specific intracellular pathways of a given receptor in specific brain areas. In the context of serotonin pharmacotherapy, 5-HT 1A receptor-biased agonists could be of great interest in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to determine whether biased agonists could be differentiated in terms of regional targeting by use of simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. We compared two 5-HT 1A -biased agonists, NLX-112 and NLX-101, injected at three different doses in anaesthetised cats (n = 4). PET imaging was acquired for 90 min after bolus administration followed by constant infusion of the 5-HT 1A radiotracer, [ 18 F]MPPF. Drug occupancy was evaluated after injection at 50\\xa0min and BOLD fMRI was simultaneously acquired to evaluate subsequent brain activation patterns. 5-HT 1A receptor occupancy was found to be dose-dependent for both agonists, but differed in magnitude and spatial distribution at equal doses with distinct BOLD patterns. Functional connectivity, as measured by BOLD signal temporal correlations between regions, was also differently modified by NLX-112 or NLX-101. Voxel-based correlation analyses between PET and fMRI suggested that NLX-112 stimulates both 5-HT 1A autoreceptors and post-synaptic receptors, whereas NLX-101 preferentially stimulates post-synaptic cortical receptors. In cingulate cortex, the agonists induced opposite BOLD signal changes in response to receptor occupancy. These data constitute the first simultaneous exploration of 5-HT 1A occupancy and its consequences in terms of brain activation, and demonstrates differential signalling by two 5-HT 1A -biased agonists. Combined PET/fMRI represents a powerful tool in neuropharmacology, and opens new ways to address the concept of biased agonism by translational approaches.\", 'Modulating the water channel AQP4 alters miRNA expression, astrocyte connectivity and water diffusion in the rodent brain. Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate water diffusion through the plasma membrane. Brain aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is present in astrocytes and has critical roles in normal and disease physiology. We previously showed that a 24.9% decrease in AQP4 expression after in vivo silencing resulted in a 45.8% decrease in tissue water mobility as interpreted from magnetic resonance imaging apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). Similar to previous in vitro studies we show decreased expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) in vivo after intracortical injection of siAQP4 in the rat. Moreover, siAQP4 induced a loss of dye-coupling between astrocytes in vitro, further demonstrating its effect on gap junctions. In contrast, silencing of Cx43 did not alter the level of AQP4 or water mobility (ADC) in the brain. We hypothesized that siAQP4 has off-target effects on Cx43 expression via modification of miRNA expression. The decreased expression of Cx43 in siAQP4-treated animals was associated with up-regulation of miR224, which is known to target AQP4 and Cx43 expression. This could be one potential molecular mechanism responsible for the effect of siAQP4 on Cx43 expression, and the resultant decrease in astrocyte connectivity and dramatic effects on ADC values and water mobility.', 'Simulation of calcium signaling in fine astrocytic processes: Effect of spatial properties on spontaneous activity. Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels IP3R, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an IP3R-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the IP3R channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.', 'Electrophysiological Investigation of Microglia. Although microglial cells are not electrically excitable, they express a large repertoire of ion channels that are activated by voltage, stretch, extracellular ligands, or intracellular pathways (e.g. Ca2+, G-proteins). The patch-clamp technique is the electrophysiological method of choice to study these channels whose expression varies largely in pathological conditions but also during normal development and aging. This chapter focuses on protocols allowing the recording and the analysis of these channels in acute brain slices, with a particular emphasis on the study of channels activated by extracellular ligands.', 'How Does Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Influence the Brain in Depressive Disorders?: A Review of Neuroimaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies. Objective Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a nonpharmacological technique used to stimulate the brain. It is a safe and proven alternative tool to treat resistant major depressive disorders (MDDs). Neuroimaging studies suggest a wide corticolimbic network is involved in MDDs. We researched observable changes in magnetic resonance imaging induced by rTMS to clarify the operational mechanism. Methods A systematic search of the international literature was performed using PubMed and Embase, using papers published up to January 1, 2017. The following MESH terms were used: (depression or major depressive disorder) and (neuroimaging or MRI) and (rTMS or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). We searched the databases using a previously defined strategy to identify potentially eligible studies. Results Both structural and functional changes were observed on magnetic resonance imagings performed before and after rTMS. Various areas of the brain were impacted when rTMS was used. Although the results were very heterogeneous, a pattern that involved the anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex emerged. These are known to be regions of interest in MDDs. However, the various parameters used in rTMS make any generalization difficult. Conclusions Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation helps to treat MDDs with good efficacy. Its effect on the brain, as observed in several neuroimaging studies, seems to impact on the structural and functional features of several networks and structures involved in major depressive disorders.', 'Cerebral microbleeds and stroke risk after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies. Background: Cerebral microbleeds are a neuroimaging biomarker of stroke risk. A crucial clinical question is whether cerebral microbleeds indicate patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in whom the rate of future intracranial haemorrhage is likely to exceed that of recurrent ischaemic stroke when treated with antithrombotic drugs. We therefore aimed to establish whether a large burden of cerebral microbleeds or particular anatomical patterns of cerebral microbleeds can identify ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack patients at higher absolute risk of intracranial haemorrhage than ischaemic stroke. Methods: We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies in adults with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited adult participants with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack; included at least 50 participants; collected data on stroke events over at least 3 months follow-up; used an appropriate MRI sequence that is sensitive to magnetic susceptibility; and documented the number and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds reliably using consensus criteria and validated scales. Our prespecified primary outcomes were a composite of any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic ischaemic stroke. We registered this study with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews, number CRD42016036602. Findings: Between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 1, 2018, we identified 344 studies. After exclusions for ineligibility or declined requests for inclusion, 20 322 patients from 38 cohorts (over 35 225 patient-years of follow-up; median 1·34 years [IQR 0·19–2·44]) were included in our analyses. The adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] comparing patients with cerebral microbleeds to those without was 1·35 (95% CI 1·20–1·50) for the composite outcome of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke; 2·45 (1·82–3·29) for intracranial haemorrhage and 1·23 (1·08–1·40) for ischaemic stroke. The aHR increased with increasing cerebral microbleed burden for intracranial haemorrhage but this effect was less marked for ischaemic stroke (for five or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR 4·55 [95% CI 3·08–6·72] for intracranial haemorrhage vs 1·47 [1·19–1·80] for ischaemic stroke; for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, aHR 5·52 [3·36–9·05] vs 1·43 [1·07–1·91]; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, aHR 8·61 [4·69–15·81] vs 1·86 [1·23–1·82]). However, irrespective of cerebral microbleed anatomical distribution or burden, the rate of ischaemic stroke exceeded that of intracranial haemorrhage (for ten or more cerebral microbleeds, 64 ischaemic strokes [95% CI 48–84] per 1000 patient-years vs 27 intracranial haemorrhages [17–41] per 1000 patient-years; and for ≥20 cerebral microbleeds, 73 ischaemic strokes [46–108] per 1000 patient-years vs 39 intracranial haemorrhages [21–67] per 1000 patient-years). Interpretation: In patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, cerebral microbleeds are associated with a greater relative hazard (aHR) for subsequent intracranial haemorrhage than for ischaemic stroke, but the absolute risk of ischaemic stroke is higher than that of intracranial haemorrhage, regardless of cerebral microbleed presence, antomical distribution, or burden.

Background: With the increasing number of genomic sequencing studies, hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The rate of gene discovery far outpaces our understanding of genotype–phenotype correlations, with clinical characterization remaining a bottleneck for understanding NDDs. Most disease-associated Mendelian genes are members of gene families, and we hypothesize that those with related molecular function share clinical presentations. Methods: We tested our hypothesis by considering gene families that have multiple members with an enrichment of de novo variants among NDDs, as determined by previous meta-analyses. One of these gene families is the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which has 33 members, five of which have been recently identified as NDD genes (HNRNPK, HNRNPU, HNRNPH1, HNRNPH2, and HNRNPR) and two of which have significant enrichment in our previous meta-analysis of probands with NDDs (HNRNPU and SYNCRIP). Utilizing protein homology, mutation analyses, gene expression analyses, and phenotypic characterization, we provide evidence for variation in 12 HNRNP genes as candidates for NDDs. Seven are potentially novel while the remaining genes in the family likely do not significantly contribute to NDD risk. Results: We report 119 new NDD cases (64 de novo variants) through sequencing and international collaborations and combined with published clinical case reports. We consider 235 cases with gene-disruptive single-nucleotide variants or indels and 15 cases with small copy number variants. Three hnRNP-encoding genes reach nominal or exome-wide significance for de novo variant enrichment, while nine are candidates for pathogenic mutations. Comparison of HNRNP gene expression shows a pattern consistent with a role in cerebral cortical development with enriched expression among radial glial progenitors. Clinical assessment of probands (n = 188–221) expands the phenotypes associated with HNRNP rare variants, and phenotypes associated with variation in the HNRNP genes distinguishes them as a subgroup of NDDs. Conclusions: Overall, our novel approach of exploiting gene families in NDDs identifies new HNRNP-related disorders, expands the phenotypes of known HNRNP-related disorders, strongly implicates disruption of the hnRNPs as a whole in NDDs, and supports that NDD subtypes likely have shared molecular pathogenesis. To date, this is the first study to identify novel genetic disorders based on the presence of disorders in related genes. We also perform the first phenotypic analyses focusing on related genes. Finally, we show that radial glial expression of these genes is likely critical during neurodevelopment. This is important for diagnostics, as well as developing strategies to best study these genes for the development of therapeutics.', 'Maternal separation in rodents: A journey from gut to brain and nutritional perspectives. The developmental period constitutes a critical window of sensitivity to stress. Indeed, early-life adversity increases the risk to develop psychiatric diseases, but also gastrointestinal disorders such as the irritable bowel syndrome at adulthood. In the past decade, there has been huge interest in the gut-brain axis, especially as regards stress-related emotional behaviours. Animal models of early-life adversity, in particular, maternal separation (MS) in rodents, demonstrate lasting deleterious effects on both the gut and the brain. Here, we review the effects of MS on both systems with a focus on stress-related behaviours. In addition, we discuss more recent findings showing the impact of gut-directed interventions, including nutrition with pre- and probiotics, illustrating the role played by gut microbiota in mediating the long-term effects of MS. Overall, preclinical studies suggest that nutritional approaches with pro- and prebiotics may constitute safe and efficient strategies to attenuate the effects of early-life stress on the gut-brain axis. Further research is required to understand the complex mechanisms underlying gut-brain interaction dysfunctions after early-life stress as well as to determine the beneficial impact of gut-directed strategies in a context of early-life adversity in human subjects.', 'Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging stratifies injury severity in a rodent model of male juvenile traumatic brain injury. Age and severity are significant predictors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in the immature brain. TBI studies have segregated TBI injury into three severity groups: mild, moderate, and severe. While mild TBI is most frequent form in children and adults, there is debate over the indicators used to denote mild injury. Clinically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are used to diagnose the TBI severity when medically warranted. Herein, we induced mild, moderate, and severe TBI in juvenile rats (jTBI) using the controlled cortical impact model. We characterized the temporal and spatial injury after graded jTBI in vivo using high-field MRI at 0.25 (6\\xa0hr), 1 and 3\\xa0days post-injury (dpi) with comparative histology. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for blood and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for edema were quantified over the 0.25–3 dpi. Edema volumes increased linearly with severity at 0.25 dpi that slowly continued to decrease over the 3 dpi. In contrast, blood volumes did not decrease over time. Mild TBI had the least amount of blood visible on SWI. Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining for cell death confirmed increased cellular death with increasing severity and increased FJB\\xa0+\\xa0cells in the corpus callosum (CC). Interestingly, the strongest correlation was observed for cell death and the presence of extravascular blood. A clear understanding of acute brain injury (jTBI) and how blood/edema contribute to mild, moderate, and severe jTBI is needed prior to embarking on therapeutic interventions. Noninvasive imaging should be used in mild jTBI to verify lack of overt injury.', 'Beyond the anatomy-based representation of brain function: Comment on “Topodynamics of metastable brains” by Arturo Tozzi et al.. ', \"Auditory-Motor Matching in Vocal Recognition and Imitative Learning. Songbirds possess mirror neurons (MNs) activating during the perception and execution of specific features of songs. These neurons are located in high vocal center (HVC), a premotor nucleus implicated in song perception, production and learning, making worth to inquire their properties and functions in vocal recognition and imitative learning. By integrating a body of brain and behavioral data, we discuss neurophysiology, anatomical, computational properties and possible functions of songbird MNs. We state that the neurophysiological properties of songbird MNs depends on sensorimotor regions that are outside the auditory neural system. Interestingly, songbirds MNs can be the result of the specific type of song representation possessed by some songbird species. At the functional level, we discuss whether songbird MNs are involved in others' song recognition, by dissecting the function of recognition in various different but possible overlapping processes: action-oriented perception, discriminative-oriented perception and identification of the signaler. We conclude that songbird MNs may be involved in recognizing other singer's vocalizations, while their role in imitative learning still require to solve how auditory feedback are used to correct own vocal performance to match the tutor song. Finally, we compare songbird and human mirror responses, hypothesizing a case of convergent evolution, and proposing new experimental directions.\", \"Using EQ•PET to reduce reconstruction-dependent variations in [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET brain imaging. This study aims at assessing whether EANM harmonisation strategy combined with EQ•PET methodology could be successfully applied to harmonize brain 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images. The NEMA NU 2 body phantom was prepared according to the EANM guidelines with an [18F]FDG solution. Raw PET phantom data were reconstructed with three different reconstruction protocols frequently used in clinical PET brain imaging: () Ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) 3D with time of flight (TOF), 2 iterations and 21 subsets; () OSEM 3D with TOF, 6 iterations and 21 subsets; and () OSEM 3D with TOF, point spread function (PSF), and 8 iterations and 21 subsets. EQ•PET filters were computed as the Gaussian smoothing that best independently aligned the recovery coefficients (RCs) of reconstructions and with the RCs of the reference reconstruction, . The performance of the EQ•PET filter to reduce variations in quantification due to differences in reconstruction was investigated using clinical PET brain images of 35 early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) patients. Qualitative assessments and multiple quantitative metrics on the cortical surface at different scale levels with or without partial volume effect correction were evaluated on the [18F]FDG brain data before and after application of the EQ•PET filter. The EQ•PET methodology succeeded in finding the optimal smoothing that minimised root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculated using human brain [18F]FDG-PET datasets of EOAD patients, providing harmonized comparisons in the neurological context. Performance was superior for TOF than for TOF + PSF reconstructions. Results showed the capability of the EQ•PET methodology to minimize reconstruction-induced variabilities between brain [18F]FDG-PET images. However, moderate variabilities remained after harmonizing PSF reconstructions with standard non-PSF OSEM reconstructions, suggesting that precautions should be taken when using PSF modelling.\", 'Chromatin remodeling dysfunction extends the etiological spectrum of schizophrenia: A case report. Background: The role of deleterious copy number variations in schizophrenia is well established while data regarding pathogenic variations remain scarce. We report for the first time a case of schizophrenia in a child with a pathogenic mutation of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) gene. Case presentation: The proband was the second child of unrelated parents. Anxiety and sleep disorders appeared at the age of 10 months. He presented febrile seizures and, at the age of 8, two generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At the age of 10, emotional withdrawal emerged, along with a flat affect, disorganization and paranoid ideation, without seizures. He began to talk and giggle with self. Eventually, the patient presented daily auditory and visual hallucinations. The diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia (DSM V) was then evoked. Brain imaging was unremarkable. Wakefulness electroencephalography showed a normal background and some bilateral spike-wave discharges that did not explain the psychosis features. A comparative genomic hybridization array (180 K, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) revealed an 867-kb 16p13.3 duplication, interpreted as a variant of unknown significance confirmed by a quantitative PCR that also showed its maternal inheritance. Risperidone (1,5 mg per day), led to clinical improvement. At the age of 11, an explosive relapse of epilepsy occurred with daily seizures of various types. The sequencing of a panel for monogenic epileptic disorders and Sanger sequencing revealed a de novo pathogenic heterozygous transition in CHD2 (NM_001271.3: c.4003G > T). Conclusions: This case underlines that schizophrenia may be, sometimes, underpinned by a Mendelian disease. It addresses the question of systematic genetic investigations in the presence of warning signs such as a childhood onset of the schizophrenia or a resistant epilepsy. It points that, in the absence of pathogenic copy number variation, the investigations should also include a search for pathogenic variations, which means that some of the patients with schizophrenia should benefit from Next Generation Sequencing tools. Last but not least, CHD2 encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family involved in chromatin remodeling. This observation adds schizophrenia to the phenotypic spectrum of chromodomain remodeling disorders, which may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches.', \"A simple rule to describe interactions between visual categories. Humans can rapidly categorise visual objects when presented in isolation. However, in everyday life we encounter multiple objects at the same time. Far less is known about how simultaneously active object representations interact. We examined such interactions by asking participants to categorise a target object at the basic (Experiment 1) or the superordinate (Experiment 2) level while the representation of another object was still active. We found that the “prime” object strongly modulated the response to the target implying that the prime's category was rapidly and automatically accessed, influencing subsequent categorical processing. Using drift diffusion modelling, we show that a prime, whose category is different from that of the target, interferes with target processing primarily during the evidence accumulation stage. This suggests that the state of category-processing neurons is altered by an active representation and this modifies the processing of other categories. Interestingly, the strength of interference increases with the similarity between the distractor and the target category. Considering these results and previous studies, we propose a general principle that category interactions are determined by the distance from a distractor's representation to the target's task-relevant categorical boundary. We argue that this principle arises from the specific architectural organisation of categories in the brain.\", \"Evidence for splice transcript variants of TMEM165, a gene involved in CDG. Background Defects in TMEM165 gene cause a type-II Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation affecting Golgi glycosylation processes. TMEM165 patients exhibit psychomotor retardation, important osteoporosis, scoliosis, irregular epiphyses and thin bone cortex. TMEM165 protein is highly conserved in evolution and belongs to the family of UPF0016 membrane proteins which could be an unique group of Ca2 +/H+ antiporters regulating Ca2 + and pH homeostasis and mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus. Methods RT-PCR from human brain tissues revealed TMEM165 splice-transcript variants. mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-Q-PCR. Expression plasmids allowed us to visualize isoform proteins and their subcellular localization. Their functions on glycosylation were achieved by looking at the gel mobility of highly glycosylated proteins in cells overexpressing isoforms. Results In this study, we highlight, as previously shown for other ion channels, the existence of TMEM165 splice-transcripts isoforms, in particular the Short-Form (SF) and the Long-Form (LF) transcripts, leading to a 129 aa and 259 aa protein isoform, respectively. These proteins both localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and have different effects on glycosylation compared to the wild-type protein (324 aa). We also point out that the SF is expressed at low levels in all human cells and tissues checked, excepted in brain, and forms homodimer. The LF was only expressed in the temporal lobe of human brain. General significance The finding of numerous splice variants could lead to a family of TMEM165 isoforms. This family of TMEM165 splice transcripts could participate in the fine regulation of TMEM165 isoforms' functions and localizations.\", 'Causal prefrontal contributions to stop-signal task performance in humans. The frontal lobes have long been implicated in inhibitory control, but a full understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. The stop-signal task has been widely used to probe instructed response inhibition in cognitive neuroscience. The processes involved have been modeled and related to putative brain substrates. However, there has been surprisingly little human lesion research using this task, with the few existing studies implicating different prefrontal regions. Here, we tested the effects of focal prefrontal damage on stop-signal task performance in a large sample of people with chronic focal damage affecting the frontal lobes (n = 42) and demographically matched healthy individuals (n = 60). Patients with damage to the left lateral, right lateral, dorsomedial, or ventromedial frontal lobe had slower stop-signal RT compared to healthy controls. There were systematic differences in the patterns of impairment across frontal subgroups: Those with damage to the left or right lateral and dorsomedial frontal lobes, but not those with ventromedial frontal damage, were slower than controls to “go” as well as to stop. These findings suggest that multiple prefrontal regions make necessary but distinct contributions to stop-signal task performance. As a consequence, stop-signal RT slowing is not strongly localizing within the frontal lobes.', 'Three-year changes of cortical <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in amnestic vs. non-amnestic sporadic early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Purpose: To examine and compare longitudinal changes of cortical glucose metabolism in amnestic and non-amnestic sporadic forms of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease and assess potential associations with neuropsychological performance over a 3-year period time. Methods: Eighty-two participants meeting criteria for early-onset (< 65\\xa0years) sporadic form of probable Alzheimer’s disease and presenting with a variety of clinical phenotypes (47 amnestic and 35 non-amnestic forms) were included at baseline and followed up for 1.44 ± 1.23\\xa0years. All of the participants underwent a work-up at baseline and every year during the follow-up period, which includes clinical examination, neuropsychological testing, genotyping, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker assays, and structural MRI and 18F-FDG PET. Vertex-wise partial volume-corrected glucose metabolic maps across the entire cortical surface were generated and longitudinally assessed together with the neuropsychological scores using linear mixed-effects modeling as a function of amnestic and non-amnestic sporadic forms of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Results: Similar evolution patterns of glucose metabolic decline between amnestic and non-amnestic forms were observed in widespread neocortical cortices. However, only non-amnestic forms appeared to have a greater reduction of glucose metabolism in lateral orbitofrontal and bilateral medial temporal cortices associated with more severe declines of neuropsychological performance compared with amnestic forms. Furthermore, results suggest that glucose metabolic decline in amnestic forms would progress along an anterior-to-posterior axis, whereas glucose metabolic decline in non-amnestic forms would progress along a posterior-to-anterior axis. Conclusions: We found differences in spatial distribution and temporal trajectory of glucose metabolic decline between amnestic and non-amnestic early-onset Alzheimer’s disease groups, suggesting that one might want to consider treating the two forms of the disease as two separate entities.', 'The Topography of Cortical Microinfarcts in Neurodegenerative Diseases and in Vascular Dementia: A Postmortem 7.0-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study. Background: Cortical microinfarcts (CoMIs) are considered as barely visible lesions in clinical-neuroradiological correlation studies. On postmortem 7.0-tesla MRI, however, CoMIs of different size are easily detected. Summary: The present MRI study investigates 84 postmortem brains with different neurodegenerative diseases and vascular dementia (VaD) for their topographic distribution and the prevalence of CoMIs. The mean numbers of CoMIs were determined on 6 hemispheric coronal sections and in 22 different gyri with a 7.0-tesla MRI Bruker BioSpin SA. A large coronal section at the level of the mammillary body was also used for neuropathological evaluation. CoMIs were predominantly observed in the prefrontal and postcentral sections of VaD brains. The mean number of CoMIs was significantly increased in the inferior frontal and in the cingulate gyri of VaD brains compared to the controls. No topographic differences were observed in the neurodegenerative diseases. Key Messages: As the inferior frontal and the cingulated gyri are areas frequently involved in VaD, CoMIs in those strategic locations must have an impact on the evolution of the vascular cognitive decline in those patients.', 'Infantile-Onset Paroxysmal Movement Disorder and Episodic Ataxia Associated with a TBC1D24 Mutation. Mutations that disrupt the TBC1D24 presynaptic protein have been implicated in various neurological disorders including epilepsy, chronic encephalopathy, DOORS (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures) syndrome, nonsyndromic hearing loss, and myoclonus. We present the case of a 22-month-old male with infantile-onset paroxysmal episodes of facial and limb myoclonus. The episodes were linked to biallelic variants in exon 2 of the TBC1D24 gene that lead to amino acid changes (c.304C >T/p.Pro102Ser and c.410T\\u2009>\\u2009C/p.Val137Ala), each variant being inherited from a parent. Follow-up imaging in adolescence revealed widened right cerebellar sulci. We discuss the evolving landscape of TBC1D24 associated phenotypes; this case adds to a growing body of evidence linking this gene to movement disorders in children.', \"pBrain: A novel pipeline for Parkinson related brain structure segmentation. Parkinson is a very prevalent neurodegenerative disease impacting the life of millions of people worldwide. Although its cause remains unknown, its functional and structural analysis is fundamental to advance in the search of a cure or symptomatic treatment. The automatic segmentation of deep brain structures related to Parkinson`s disease could be beneficial for the follow up and treatment planning. Unfortunately, there is not broadly available segmentation software to automatically measure Parkinson related structures. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline to segment three deep brain structures related to Parkinson's disease (substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and red nucleus). The proposed method is based on the multi-atlas label fusion technology that works on standard and high-resolution T2-weighted images. The proposed method also includes as post-processing a new neural network-based error correction step to minimize systematic segmentation errors. The proposed method has been compared to other state-of-the-art methods showing competitive results in terms of accuracy and execution time.\", 'CB<inf>1</inf> Cannabinoid Receptors Mediate Cognitive Deficits and Structural Plasticity Changes During Nicotine Withdrawal. Background Tobacco withdrawal is associated with deficits in cognitive function, including attention, working memory, and episodic memory. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms involved in these effects is crucial because cognitive deficits during nicotine withdrawal may predict relapse in humans. Methods We investigated in mice the role of CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) in memory impairment and spine density changes induced by nicotine withdrawal precipitated by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. Drugs acting on the endocannabinoid system and genetically modified mice were used. Results Memory impairment during nicotine withdrawal was blocked by the CB1R antagonist rimonabant or the genetic deletion of CB1R in forebrain gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons (GABA-CB1R). An increase of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but not anandamide, was observed during nicotine withdrawal. The selective inhibitor of 2-AG biosynthesis O7460 abolished cognitive deficits of nicotine abstinence, whereas the inhibitor of 2-AG enzymatic degradation JZL184 did not produce any effect in cognitive impairment. Moreover, memory impairment was prevented by the selective mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. Mature dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal hippocampal neurons decreased 4 days after the precipitation of nicotine withdrawal, when the cognitive deficits were still present. Indeed, a correlation between memory performance and mature spine density was found. Interestingly, these structural plasticity alterations were normalized in GABA-CB1R conditional knockout mice and after subchronic treatment with rimonabant. Conclusions These findings underline the interest of CB1R as a target to improve cognitive performance during early nicotine withdrawal. Cognitive deficits in early abstinence are associated with increased relapse risk.', 'Coexpression profiles reveal hidden gene networks. ', \"Cognitive phenotypes in parkinson's disease differ in terms of brain-network organization and connectivity. Cognitive deficits are common in Parkinson's disease and we suspect that dysfunctions of connected brain regions can be the source of these deficits. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity according to differences in cognitive profiles in Parkinson's disease. 119 participants were enrolled and divided into four groups according to their cognitive phenotypes (determined by a cluster analysis): (i) 31 cognitively intact patients (G1), (ii) 31 patients with only slight mental slowing (G2), (iii) 43 patients with mild to moderate deficits mainly in executive functions (G3), (iv) 14 patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains (G4–5). Rs-fMRI whole-brain connectivity was examined by two complementary approaches: graph theory for studying network functional organization and network-based statistics (NBS) for exploring functional connectivity amongst brain regions. After adjustment for age, duration of formal education and center of acquisition, there were significant group differences for all functional organization indexes: functional organization decreased (G1 > G2 > G3 > G4-5) as cognitive impairment worsened. Between-group differences in functional connectivity (NBS corrected, P < 0.01) mainly concerned the ventral prefrontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices as well as the basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, brain network organization is progressively disrupted as cognitive impairment worsens, with an increasing number of altered connections between brain regions. We observed reduced connectivity in highly associative areas, even in patients with only slight mental slowing. The association of slowed mental processing with loss of connectivity between highly associative areas could be an early marker of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and may contribute to the detection of prodromal forms of Parkinson's disease dementia.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., $\\\\ell -{1}$ and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., N -dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.\", \"The diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. Introduction: This study investigated the diagnostic and disease-monitoring potential of plasma biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Methods: Plasma was analyzed using Simoa assays from 99 CU, 107 MCI, and 103 AD dementia participants. Results: Phosphorylated-tau181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light, amyloid-β (Aβ42/40), Total-tau and Glial fibrillary acidic protein were altered\\xa0in AD dementia but P-tau181 significantly outperformed all biomarkers in differentiating AD dementia from CU (area under the curve [AUC]\\xa0=\\xa00.91). P-tau181 was increased in MCI converters compared to non-converters. Higher P-tau181 was associated with steeper cognitive decline and gray matter loss in temporal regions. Longitudinal change of P-tau181 was strongly associated with gray matter loss in the full sample and with Aβ measures in CU individuals. Discussion: P-tau181 detected AD at MCI and dementia stages and was strongly associated with cognitive decline and gray matter loss. These findings highlight the potential value of plasma P-tau181 as a non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in AD.\", \"iELVis: An open source MATLAB toolbox for localizing and visualizing human intracranial electrode data. Background Intracranial electrical recordings (iEEG) and brain stimulation (iEBS) are invaluable human neuroscience methodologies. However, the value of such data is often unrealized as many laboratories lack tools for localizing electrodes relative to anatomy. To remedy this, we have developed a MATLAB toolbox for intracranial electrode localization and visualization, iELVis. New method iELVis uses existing tools (BioImage Suite, FSL, and FreeSurfer) for preimplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation, neuroimaging coregistration, and manual identification of electrodes in postimplant neuroimaging. Subsequently, iELVis implements methods for correcting electrode locations for postimplant brain shift with millimeter-scale accuracy and provides interactive visualization on 3D surfaces or in 2D slices with optional functional neuroimaging overlays. iELVis also localizes electrodes relative to FreeSurfer-based atlases and can combine data across subjects via the FreeSurfer average brain. Results It takes 30–60 min of user time and 12–24 h of computer time to localize and visualize electrodes from one brain. We demonstrate iELVis's functionality by showing that three methods for mapping primary hand somatosensory cortex (iEEG, iEBS, and functional MRI) provide highly concordant results. Comparison with existing methods iELVis is the first public software for electrode localization that corrects for brain shift, maps electrodes to an average brain, and supports neuroimaging overlays. Moreover, its interactive visualizations are powerful and its tutorial material is extensive. Conclusions iELVis promises to speed the progress and enhance the robustness of intracranial electrode research.

Results: A panel of proteins (n = 44), along with age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, predicted brain amyloid deposition with good performance in both the discovery group (area under the curve = 0.78) and the replication group (area under the curve = 0.68). Furthermore, a causal relationship between amyloid and tau was confirmed by Mendelian randomization. Discussion: The results suggest that high-dimensional plasma protein testing could be a useful and reproducible approach for measuring brain amyloid deposition.\", 'Cross-sectional and prospective associations between β-Amyloid in the brain and chair rise performance in nondementia older adults with spontaneous memory complaints. Background: The objectives of this study were to examine the cross-sectional and prospective associations of muscle functional performance as assessed by a chair rise test and brain amyloid load among nondemented older adults with spontaneous memory complaints. Methods: This is a secondary analysis, with an observational design, using data from the MAPT randomized controlled trial. Individuals assessed for brain amyloid load (florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography) and without clinical dementia (N = 269 aged 75.2±4.2 years; 60.2% women) participated in the study. Cortical and regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were obtained. The main outcome measure was the 5-repetition chair rise performance (maximum speed-higher is better), which was assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Adjusted multiple linear (cross-sectional) and mixed-effect (overtime) regressions were performed. Results: Any of mean cortical (regions of interest) and each regional SUVRs (anterior cingulate, anterior putamen, caudate, hippocampus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, pons, posterior cingulate, posterior putamen, precuneus, semioval center, and temporal cortex) were not associated to chair rise after adjustment for multiplicity. These findings were obtained for both cross-sectional and prospective associations. Conclusions: Brain amyloid was not found to be associated to chair rise performance in nondemented older adults with memory complaints. Potential mechanisms on the links, if any, of amyloid load with physical performance are probably not dependent on muscle function.', 'Burden of dilated perivascular spaces, an emerging marker of cerebral small vessel disease, is highly heritable. Background and Purpose - The genetic contribution to dilated perivascular space (dPVS) burden - an emerging MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease - is unknown. We measured the heritability of dPVS burden and its shared heritability with other MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease. Methods - The study sample comprised 1597 participants from the population-based Three City (3C) Dijon Study, with brain MRI and genome-wide genotyping (mean age, 72.8±4.1 years; 61% women). dPVS burden and lacunar brain infarcts were rated on a semiquantitative scale, whereas an automated algorithm generated white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). We estimated dPVS burden heritability and shared heritability with WMHV and lacunar brain infarcts using the genome-wide complex trait analysis tool, on unrelated participants, adjusting for age, sex, intracranial volume, and principal components of population stratification. Results - dPVS burden was significantly correlated with WMHV and lacunar brain infarcts, the strongest correlation being found between WMHV and dPVS in basal ganglia. Heritability estimates were h2=0.59±0.24 (P=0.007) for dPVS burden, h2=0.54±0.24 (P=0.010) for WMHV, and h2=0.48±0.81 (P=0.278) for lacunar brain infarcts. We found a nonsignificant trend toward shared heritability between dPVS and WMHV (rg=0.41±0.28; P=0.096), which seemed driven by dPVS in basal ganglia (rg=0.72±0.61; P=0.126) and not dPVS in white matter (rg=-0.10±0.36; P=0.393). A genetic risk score for WMHV based on published loci was associated with increased dPVS burden in basal ganglia (P=0.031). Conclusions - We provide evidence for important genetic contribution to dPVS burden in older community-dwelling people, some of which may be shared with WMHV. Differential heritability patterns for dPVS in white matter and basal ganglia suggest at least partly distinct underlying biological processes.', \"Nilotinib Fails to Prevent Synucleinopathy and Cell Loss in a Mouse Model of Multiple System Atrophy. Background: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of α-synuclein in oligodendroglial inclusions. As such, MSA is a synucleinopathy along with Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Activation of the abelson tyrosine kinase c-Abl leads to phosphorylation of α-synuclein at tyrosine 39, thereby promoting its aggregation and subsequent neurodegeneration. The c-Abl inhibitor nilotinib used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia based on data collected in preclinical models of PD might interfere with pathogenic mechanisms that are relevant to PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, which motivated its assessment in an open-label clinical trial in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies patients. The objective of this study was to assess the preclinical efficacy of nilotinib in the specific context of MSA. Methods: Mice expressing human wild-type α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes received daily injection of nilotinib (1 or 10 mg/kg) over 12 weeks. Postmortem analysis included the assessment of c-Abl activation, α-synuclein burden, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Results: α-Synuclein phosphorylated at tyrosine 39 was detected in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA patients. Increased activation of c-Abl and α-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 were found in transgenic mice. Despite significant inhibition of c-Abl and associated reduction of α-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 by 40%, nilotinib failed to reduce α-synuclein aggregate burden (including phosphorylation at serine 129) in the striatum and cortex or to lessen neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. Conclusions: This preclinical study suggests that partial inhibition of c-Abl and reduction of α-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 may not be a relevant target for MSA. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\", 'Maternal alcoholism and neonatal hypoxia-ischemia: Neuroprotection by stilbenoid polyphenols. The impact of maternal nutrition on neurodevelopment and neonatal neuroprotection is a research topic with increasing interest. Maternal diet can also have deleterious effects on fetal brain development. Fetal exposure to alcohol is responsible for poor neonatal global development, and may increase brain vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, one of the major causes of acute mortality and chronic neurological disability in newborns. Despite frequent prevention campaigns, about 10% of women in the general population drinks alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This study was inspired by this alarming fact. Its aim was to evaluate the beneficial effects of maternal supplementation with two polyphenols during pregnancy and breastfeeding, on hypoxic-ischemic neonate rat brain damages, sensorimotor and cognitive impairments, in a context of moderate maternal alcoholism. Both stilbenoid polyphenols, trans-resveratrol (RSV − 0.15 mg/kg/day), and its hydroxylated analog, trans-piceatannol (PIC − 0.15 mg/kg/day), were administered in the drinking water, containing or not alcohol (0.5 g/kg/day). In a 7-day post-natal rat model of hypoxia–ischemia (HI), our data showed that moderate maternal alcoholism does not increase brain lesion volumes measured by MRI but leads to higher motor impairments. RSV supplementation could not reverse the deleterious effects of HI coupled with maternal alcoholism. However, PIC supplementation led to a recovery of all sensorimotor and cognitive functions. This neuroprotection was obtained with a dose of PIC corresponding to the consumption of a single passion fruit per day for a pregnant woman.', \"Real-time monitoring of tissue displacement and temperature changes during MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Purpose: The therapy endpoint most commonly used in MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound is the thermal dose. Although namely correlated with nonviable tissue, it does not account for changes in mechanical properties of tissue during ablation. This study presents a new acquisition sequence for multislice, subsecond and simultaneous imaging of tissue temperature and displacement during ablation. Methods: A single-shot echo planar imaging sequence was implemented using a pair of motion-encoding gradients, with alternated polarities. A first ultrasound pulse was synchronized on the second lobe of the motion-encoding gradients and followed by continuous sonication to induce a local temperature increase in ex vivo muscle and in vivo on pig liver. Lastly, the method was evaluated in the brain of two volunteers to assess method's precision. Results: For thermal doses higher than the lethal threshold, displacement amplitude was reduced by 21% and 28% at the focal point in muscle and liver, respectively. Displacement value remained nearly constant for nonlethal thermal doses values. The mean standard deviation of temperature and displacement in the brain of volunteers remained below 0.8 °C and 2.5 µm. Conclusion: This new fast imaging sequence provides real-time measurement of temperature distribution and displacement at the focus during HIFU ablation.

Microlissencephaly is a rare brain malformation characterized by congenital microcephaly and lissencephaly. Microlissencephaly is suspected to result from abnormalities in the proliferation or survival of neural progenitors. Despite the recent identification of six genes involved in microlissencephaly, the pathophysiological basis of this condition remains poorly understood. We performed triobased whole exome sequencing in seven subjects from five non-consanguineous families who presented with either microcephaly or microlissencephaly. This led to the identification of compound heterozygous mutations in WDR81, a gene previously associated with cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability and quadrupedal locomotion. Patient phenotypes ranged from severe microcephaly with extremely reduced gyration with pontocerebellar hypoplasia to moderate microcephaly with cerebellar atrophy. In patient fibroblast cells, WDR81 mutations were associated with increased mitotic index and delayed prometaphase/metaphase transition. Similarly, in vivo, we showed that knockdown of the WDR81 orthologue in Drosophila led to increased mitotic index of neural stem cells with delayed mitotic progression. In summary, we highlight the broad phenotypic spectrum of WDR81-related brain malformations, which include microcephaly with moderate to extremely reduced gyration and cerebellar anomalies. Our results suggest that WDR81 might have a role in mitosis that is conserved between Drosophila and humans.', 'Transcriptional regulation of CRMP5 controls neurite outgrowth through Sox5. Transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in neuronal polarity is a key process that underlies the ability of neurons to transfer information in the central nervous system. The Collapsin Response Mediator Protein (CRMP) family is best known for its role in neurite outgrowth regulation conducting to neuronal polarity and axonal guidance, including CRMP5 that drives dendrite differentiation. Although CRMP5 is able to control dendritic development, the regulation of its expression remains poorly understood. Here we identify a Sox5 consensus binding sequence in the putative promoter sequence upstream of the CRMP5 gene. By luciferase assays we show that Sox5 increases CRMP5 promoter activity, but not if the putative Sox5 binding site is mutated. We demonstrate that Sox5 can physically bind to the CRMP5 promoter DNA in gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using a combination of real-time RT-PCR and quantitative immunocytochemistry, we provide further evidence for a Sox5-dependent upregulation of CRMP5 transcription and protein expression in N1E115 cells: a commonly used cell line model for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we report that increasing Sox5 levels in this neuronal cell line inhibits neurite outgrowth. This inhibition requires CRMP5 because CRMP5 knockdown prevents the Sox5-dependent effect. We confirm the physiological relevance of the Sox5–CRMP5 pathway in the regulation of neurite outgrowth using mouse primary hippocampal neurons. These findings identify Sox5 as a critical modulator of neurite outgrowth through the selective activation of CRMP5 expression.', \"Effects of maternal low-protein diet and spontaneous physical activity on the transcription of neurotrophic factors in the placenta and the brains of mothers and offspring rats. Maternal protein restriction and physical activity can affect the interaction mother-placenta-fetus. This study quantified the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurothrophin 4, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB/NTRK2), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1r) in the different areas of mother's brain (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cortex), placenta, and fetus' brain of rats. Female Wistar rats (n = 20) were housed in cages containing a running wheel for 4 weeks before gestation. According to the distance spontaneously traveled daily, rats were classified as inactive or active. During gestation, on continued access to the running wheel, active and inactive groups were randomized to receive normoprotein diet (18% protein) or a low-protein (LP) diet (8% protein). At day 20 of gestation, gene expression of neurotrophic factors was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in different brain areas and the placenta. Dams submitted to a LP diet during gestation showed upregulation of IGF-1r and BDNF messenger RNA in the hypothalamus, IGF-1r and NTRK2 in the hippocampus, and BDNF, NTRK2, IGF-1 and IGF-1r in the cortex. In the placenta, there was a downregulation of IGF-1. In the brain of pups from mothers on LP diet, IGF-1r and NTRK2 were downregulated. Voluntary physical activity attenuated the effects of LP diet on IGF-1r in the hypothalamus, IGF-1r and NTRK2 in the hippocampus, IGF-1 in the placenta, and NTRK2 in the fetus' brain. In conclusion, both maternal protein restriction and spontaneous physical activity influence the gene expression of BDNF, NTRK2, IGF-1, and IGF-1r, with spontaneous physical activity being able to normalize in part the defects caused by protein restriction during pregnancy.\", \"Functional brain network centrality is related to APOE genotype in cognitively normal elderly. Introduction: Amyloid plaque deposition in the brain is an early pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD), causing disrupted synaptic connections. Brain network disruptions in AD have been demonstrated with eigenvector centrality (EC), a measure that identifies central regions within networks. Carrying an apolipoprotein (APOE)-ε4 allele is a genetic risk for AD, associated with increased amyloid deposition. We studied whether APOE-ε4 carriership is associated with EC disruptions in cognitively normal individuals. Methods: A total of 261 healthy middle-aged to older adults (mean age 56.6\\xa0years) were divided into high-risk (APOE-ε4 carriers) and low-risk (noncarriers) groups. EC was computed from resting-state functional MRI data. Clusters of between-group differences were assessed with a permutation-based method. Correlations between cluster mean EC with brain volume, CSF biomarkers, and psychological test scores were assessed. Results: Decreased EC in the visual cortex was associated with APOE-ε4 carriership, a genetic risk factor for AD. EC differences were correlated with age, CSF amyloid levels, and scores on the trail-making and 15-object recognition tests. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the APOE-ε4 genotype affects brain connectivity in regions previously found to be abnormal in AD as a sign of very early disease-related pathology. These differences were too subtle in healthy elderly to use EC for single-subject prediction of APOE genotype.\", 'Unveiling the extracellular space of the brain: From super-resolved microstructure to in vivo function. The extracellular space occupies approximately one-fifth of brain volume, molding a spider web of gaps filled with interstitial fluid and extracellular matrix where neurons and glial cells perform in concert. Yet, very little is known about the spatial organization and dynamics of the extracellular space, let alone its influence on brain function, owing to a lack of appropriate techniques (and a traditional bias toward the inside of cells, not the spaces in between). At the same time, it is clear that understanding fundamental brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, memory, sleep, and recovery from disease, calls for more focused research on the extracellular space of the brain. This review article highlights several key research areas, covering recent methodological and conceptual progress that illuminates this understudied, yet critically important, brain compartment, providing insights into the opportunities and challenges of this nascent field.', 'At what latency does the phase of brain oscillations influence perception?. Recent evidence has shown a rhythmic modulation of perception: prestimulus ongoing electroencephalography (EEG) phase in the θ (4–8 Hz) and α (8–13 Hz) bands has been directly linked with fluctuations in target detection. In fact, the ongoing EEG phase directly reflects cortical excitability: it acts as a gating mechanism for information flow at the neuronal level. Consequently, the key phase modulating perception should be the one present in the brain when the stimulus is actually being processed. Most previous studies, however, reported phase modulation peaking 100 ms or more before target onset. To explain this discrepancy, we first use simulations showing that contamination of spontaneous oscillatory signals by target-evoked ERP and signal filtering (e.g., wavelet) can result in an apparent shift of the peak phase modulation towards earlier latencies, potentially reaching the prestimulus period. We then present a paradigm based on linear systems analysis which can uncover the true latency at which ongoing EEG phase influences perception. After measuring the impulse response function, we use it to reconstruct (rather than record) the brain activity of human observers during white noise sequences. We can then present targets in those sequences, and reliably estimate EEG phase around these targets without any influence of the target-evoked response. We find that in these reconstructed signals, the important phase for perception is that of fronto-occipital ~6 Hz background oscillations at about 75 ms after target onset. These results confirm the causal influence of phase on perception at the time the stimulus is effectively processed in the brain.', 'The Need of a Paradigm Shift to Better Understand PiT1 and PiT2 Biology: Response to “Why Is There No PiT1/SLC20A1 Pathogenic Variants Yet Linked to Primary Familial Brain Calcification?”.

Synthetic cannabinoids have emerged as novel psychoactive substances with damaging consequences for public health. They exhibit high affinity at the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor and produce similar and often more potent effects as other CB1 receptor agonists. However, we are still far from a complete pharmacological understanding of these compounds. In this study, by using behavioral, molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches, we aimed at characterizing several in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of the synthetic cannabinoid MMB-Fubinaca (also known as AMB-Fubinaca or FUB-AMB), a particular synthetic cannabinoid. MMB-Fubinaca stimulates CB1 receptor-mediated functional coupling to G-proteins in mouse and human brain preparations in a similar manner as the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,512-2 but with a much greater potency. Both drugs similarly activate the CB1 receptor-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Notably, in vivo administration of MMB-Fubinaca in mice induced greater behavioral and electrophysiological effects in male than in female mice in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. Overall, these data provide a solid pharmacological profiling of the effects of MMB-Fubinaca and important information about the mechanisms of action underlying its harmful impact in humans. At the same time, they reinforce the significant sexual dimorphism of cannabinoid actions, which will have to be taken into account in future animal and clinical studies.', 'Correlative analysis of dopaminergic and serotonergic metabolism across the brain to study monoaminergic function and interaction. Background The widespread innervation of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems in cortical and subcortical regions suggests that their biochemical interactions can occur in multiple regions directly or indirectly via neurobiological networks. New method The present study was aimed at validating a neurochemical approach of monoaminergic function based on inter-individual variability of monoamine tissue contents in various cortical and subcortical areas. We focused on monoamines metabolism and examined correlations within and between these monoaminergic systems in selected regions for the metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and/or homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) alone or with respect to the turnover indexes DOPAC/DA, DOPAC\\xa0+\\xa0HVA/DA and 5-HIAA/5-HT. Results The tissue content of metabolites and their parent drug correlated within a brain region. Conversely, a few specific relationships (10%) were observed for each turnover in paired brain regions and even less between the 5-HT and DA turnovers. The number of correlations was lower when looking at the metabolite tissue contents. In all cases, the 5-HT and DA turnover indexes or metabolites correlated positively within a brain region. Comparison with existing method(s) These data validate the inter-individual analysis of monoamine tissue content by providing evidence that the metabolite correlates with the parent neurotransmitter in the same region. The pattern of correlations of metabolisms reported here differs from that of the parent neurotransmitters, notably regarding the relationships of DA turnovers between striatal territories. Conclusion The whole neurochemical approach is of interest for characterizing monoaminergic systems interaction in various genetic or pharmacological models of neuropsychiatric diseases.', \"Clinical relevance of brain atrophy subtypes categorization in memory clinics. Introduction: The clinical relevance of brain atrophy subtypes categorization in non-demented persons without a priori knowledge regarding their amyloid status or clinical presentation is unknown. Methods: A total of 2083 outpatients with either subjective cognitive complaint or mild cognitive impairment at study entry were followed during 4 years (MEMENTO cohort). Atrophy subtypes were defined using baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and previously described algorithms. Results: Typical/diffuse atrophy was associated with faster cognitive decline and the highest risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) over time, both in the whole analytic sample and in amyloid-positive participants. Hippocampal-sparing and limbic-predominant atrophy were also associated with incident dementia, with faster cognitive decline in the limbic predominant atrophy group. Lewy body dementia was more frequent in the hippocampal-sparing and minimal/no atrophy groups. Discussion: Atrophy subtypes categorization predicted different subsequent patterns of cognitive decline and rates of conversion to distinct etiologies of dementia in persons attending memory clinics.\", 'Reproducibility and variability of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging markers in cerebral small vessel disease. Brain imaging is essential for the diagnosis and characterization of cerebral small vessel disease. Several magnetic resonance imaging markers have therefore emerged, providing new information on the diagnosis, progression, and mechanisms of small vessel disease. Yet, the reproducibility of these small vessel disease markers has received little attention despite being widely used in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This review focuses on the main small vessel disease-related markers on magnetic resonance imaging including: white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain volume. The aim is to summarize, for each marker, what is currently known about: (1) its reproducibility in studies with a scan-rescan procedure either in single or multicenter settings; (2) the acquisition-related sources of variability; and, (3) the techniques used to minimize this variability. Based on the results, we discuss technical and other challenges that need to be overcome in order for these markers to be reliably used as outcome measures in future clinical trials. We also highlight the key points that need to be considered when designing multicenter magnetic resonance imaging studies of small vessel disease.', 'Mind-wandering, or the allocation of attentional resources, is sleep-driven across childhood. Mind-wandering or the spontaneous, uncontrolled changes in the allocation of attention resources (lapses) may cause variability in performance. In childhood, the relationship between the activation state of the brain, such as in attentional performance, and sleep has not been explored in detail. We investigated the role of sleep in attentional performance, and explored the most important parameters of their relationship. We objectively measured momentary lapses of attention of 522 children and correlated them with sleep schedules. In the subgroup of young children (age 7.1 ± 0.6 years; 60.8% girls), increasing age, long sleep duration and assessment closer to the previous night’s sleep period was associated with impaired performance speed and consistency. From pre-adolescence (age 9.4 ± 0.8 years; 50.5% girls) onwards somno-typologies may develop. As a result, in adolescence (age 13.4 ± 1.2 years; 51.3% girls) not only sleep duration but also sleep midpoint and sleep regularity influence the individual speed and stability of attention. Across development, regularity of sleep, individual sleep midpoint and bedtime become increasingly important for optimal performance throughout the day. Attentional performance and sleep shared almost half of their variance, and performance was sleep-driven across childhood. Future studies should focus on intra- and inter-individual differences in sleep-wake behavior to improve performance or decrease mind-wandering in youth by targeting sleep habits.', 'Central nervous system Aquaporin4 autoimmunity revealed by a single pseudotumoral encephalic lesion. The radiological spectrum of neuromyelitis optica has become broader since the detection of aquaporin4 antibodies. We report a case of neuromyelitis optica patient with pseudotumoral encephalic lesion. A 66\\xa0year-old woman presented with sudden left lateral homonymous hemianopsia. A brain MRI showed an isolated and extensive right temporo-parieto-occipital lesion, involving periventricular white matter and the corpus callosum, with strong enhancement on post-gadolinium T1 weighted images, highly suggestive of lymphoma. Spinal cord MRI and body CT scan were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis, raised total protein level without abnormal cells or oligoclonal bands. A brain biopsy demonstrated non-specific demyelination. Serum aquaporin4 antibodies were positive, which was consistent with the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica. Cases of central nervous system aquaporin4 autoimmunity presenting with an isolated brain lesion without optic neuritis or myelitis are extremely rare: this is the second case so far and the first one with advanced magnetic resonance characterization. Pseudotumoral encephalic lesions should include a large differential diagnosis, and testing aquaporin4 antibodies must be considered in order to avoid brain biopsy.', 'What\\'s behind a \"+\" Sign? Perceiving an Arithmetic Operator Recruits Brain Circuits for Spatial Orienting. Do mathematical symbols evoke spatial representations? Although behavioral studies have long demonstrated interactions between space and the processing of Arabic digits, how to interpret these results remains controversial. Here, we tested whether activity in regions supporting spatial processing contributes to the processing of symbols conveying fundamental arithmetic concepts - such as operation signs - even in the absence of associated digits. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that merely perceiving a \"+\"sign triggers activity in brain regions that support the orienting of spatial attention in adults. Activity in these regions was greater for \"+\"than for \"×\"signs, indicating that it is modulated by whether an operator reflects an operation that evokes numerical manipulation (rather than rote memorization). Finally, the degree to which subjects activated a spatial region in response to a \"+\"sign was correlated with the degree to which subjects benefited from being briefly presented with that sign before having to calculate a single-digit addition problem, an effect termed operator-priming. Therefore, not only are some arithmetic operators linked to spatial intuitions, but such intuitions might also have an important role during arithmetic calculation. More generally, our findings support the view that mathematical symbols inherently evoke spatial representations.', 'A quest for Q fever. ', 'The link between structural connectivity and neurocognition illustrated by focal epilepsy. Increasing attention is being paid to the assessment of white matter properties and its structural connectivity, both in healthy subjects and patients with cerebral lesions. Within this framework, new neurocognitive models based on hodological properties have been developed under a connectomic perspective in order to explain substrates and cognitive mechanisms related to cerebral functions such as language and memory. With regards to focal and drug-resistant epilepsy conceived as a network disorder, new insights in terms of structural connectivity have led to significant advances in epilepsy research, concerning fundamental research (neurocognitive mechanisms of plasticity) and clinical application (optimization of decision making for curative surgery). We believe that such findings in the literature, focused on the role of white matter in cerebral functioning in relation to neurocognition, may be helpful for both researchers and clinicians working in the field of epilepsy.', 'Analysis the link between periodontal diseases and alzheimer’s disease: A systematic review. The hypothesis of an infectious connection from the oro-pharyngeal sphere to the brain underlines the interest in analyzing the link between periodontal disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the link between Alzheimer’s disease and periodontal disease in patients aged 65 and over. Databases (PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library, and Embase) were analyzed for relevant references up to 21 June 2021. The authors independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The quality of included studies was checked using the National Institutes of Health’s quality assessment tools. Five studies were included. The selected studies described in their results an increase in F. nucleatum in Alzheimer’s disease patients (adjusted p = 0.02), and its incidence was linked to C. rectus and P. gingivalis (adjusted HR = 1.22 (1.04–1.43), p = 0.012) as well as A. naeslundii (crude HR = 2.0 (1.1–3.8)). The presence of periodontitis at baseline was associated with a six-fold increase in the rate of cognitive decline over a 6-month follow-up period (ADAS-Cog mean change = 2.9 ± 6.6). The current review suggests an association between periodontal disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The treatment of periodontal disease could be a way to explore Alzheimer’s disease prevention.', 'DLG4-related synaptopathy: a new rare brain disorder. Purpose: Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded by DLG4, regulates excitatory synaptic function in the brain. Here we present the clinical and genetic features of 53 patients (42 previously unpublished) with DLG4 variants. Methods: The clinical and genetic information were\\xa0collected through GeneMatcher collaboration. All the individuals were investigated by local clinicians and the gene variants were identified by clinical exome/genome sequencing. Results: The clinical picture was predominated by early onset global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, all of which point to a brain disorder. Marfanoid habitus, which was previously suggested to be a characteristic feature of DLG4-related phenotypes, was found in only nine individuals and despite some overlapping features, a distinct facial dysmorphism could not\\xa0be established. Of the 45 different DLG4 variants, 39 were predicted to lead to loss of protein function and the majority occurred de novo (four with unknown origin). The six missense variants identified were suggested to lead to structural or functional changes by protein modeling studies. Conclusion: The present study shows that clinical manifestations associated with DLG4 overlap with those found in other neurodevelopmental disorders of synaptic dysfunction; thus, we designate this group of disorders as DLG4-related synaptopathy. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]', \"Neural changes associated to procedural learning and automatization process in Developmental Coordination Disorder and/or Developmental Dyslexia. Objective Recent theories hypothesize that procedural learning may support the frequent overlap between neurodevelopmental disorders. The neural circuitry supporting procedural learning includes, among others, cortico-cerebellar and cortico-striatal loops. Alteration of these loops may account for the frequent comorbidity between Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and Developmental Dyslexia (DD). The aim of our study was to investigate cerebral changes due to the learning and automatization of a sequence learning task in children with DD, or DCD, or both disorders. Method fMRI on 48 children (aged 8-12) with DD, DCD or DD\\xa0+\\xa0DCD was used to explore their brain activity during procedural tasks, performed either after two weeks of training or in the early stage of learning. Results Firstly, our results indicate that all children were able to perform the task with the same level of automaticity, but recruit different brain processes to achieve the same performance. Secondly, our fMRI results do not appear to confirm Nicolson and Fawcett's model. The neural correlates recruited for procedural learning by the DD and the comorbid groups are very close, while the DCD group presents distinct characteristics. This provide a promising direction on the neural mechanisms associated with procedural learning in neurodevelopmental disorders and for understanding comorbidity.\", 'Brain synchronizability, a false friend. Synchronization plays a fundamental role in healthy cognitive and motor function. However, how synchronization depends on the interplay between local dynamics, coupling and topology and how prone to synchronization a network is, given its topological organization, are still poorly understood issues. To investigate the synchronizability of both anatomical and functional brain networks various studies resorted to the Master Stability Function (MSF) formalism, an elegant tool which allows analysing the stability of synchronous states in a dynamical system consisting of many coupled oscillators. Here, we argue that brain dynamics does not fulfil the formal criteria under which synchronizability is usually quantified and, perhaps more importantly, this measure refers to a global dynamical condition that never holds in the brain (not even in the most pathological conditions), and therefore no neurophysiological conclusions should be drawn based on it. We discuss the meaning of synchronizability and its applicability to neuroscience and propose alternative ways to quantify brain networks synchronization.', 'Intrinsic Connectivity Patterns of Task-Defined Brain Networks Allow Individual Prediction of Cognitive Symptom Dimension of Schizophrenia and Are Linked to Molecular Architecture. Background: Despite the marked interindividual variability in the clinical presentation of schizophrenia, the extent to which individual dimensions of psychopathology relate to the functional variability in brain networks among patients remains unclear. Here, we address this question using network-based predictive modeling of individual psychopathology along 4 data-driven symptom dimensions. Follow-up analyses assess the molecular underpinnings of predictive networks by relating them to neurotransmitter-receptor distribution patterns. Methods: We investigated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 147 patients with schizophrenia recruited at 7 sites. Individual expression along negative, positive, affective, and cognitive symptom dimensions was predicted using a relevance vector machine based on functional connectivity within 17 meta-analytic task networks following repeated 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out analyses. Results were validated in an independent sample. Networks robustly predicting individual symptom dimensions were spatially correlated with density maps of 9 receptors/transporters from prior molecular imaging in healthy populations. Results: Tenfold and leave-one-site-out analyses revealed 5 predictive network-symptom associations. Connectivity within theory of mind, cognitive reappraisal, and mirror neuron networks predicted negative, positive, and affective symptom dimensions, respectively. Cognitive dimension was predicted by theory of mind and socioaffective default networks. Importantly, these predictions generalized to the independent sample. Intriguingly, these two networks were positively associated with D1 receptor and serotonin reuptake transporter densities as well as dopamine synthesis capacity. Conclusions: We revealed a robust association between intrinsic functional connectivity within networks for socioaffective processes and the cognitive dimension of psychopathology. By investigating the molecular architecture, this work links dopaminergic and serotonergic systems with the functional topography of brain networks underlying cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia.', 'Lipocalin-2 is an anorexigenic signal in primates. In the mouse, the osteoblast-derived hormone Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) suppresses food intake and acts as a satiety signal. We show here that meal challenges increase serum LCN2 levels in persons with normal or overweight, but not in individuals with obesity. Postprandial LCN2 serum levels correlate inversely with hunger sensation in challenged subjects. We further show through brain PET scans of monkeys injected with radiolabeled recombinant human LCN2 (rh-LCN2) and autoradiography in baboon, macaque, and human brain sections, that LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier and localizes to the hypothalamus in primates. In addition, daily treatment of lean monkeys with rh-LCN2 decreases food intake by 21%, without overt side effects. These studies demonstrate the biology of LCN2 as a satiety factor and indicator and anorexigenic signal in primates. Failure to stimulate postprandial LCN2 in individuals with obesity may contribute to metabolic dysregulation, suggesting that LCN2 may be a novel target for obesity treatment.', 'Spatially regularized multifractal analysis for fMRI data. Scale-free dynamics is nowadays a massively used paradigm to model infraslow macroscopic brain activity. Multifractal analysis is becoming the standard tool to characterize scale-free dynamics. It is commonly used on various modalities of neuroimaging data to evaluate whether arrhythmic fluctuations in ongoing or evoked brain activity are related to pathologies (Alzheimer, epilepsy) or task performance. The success of multifractal analysis in neurosciences remains however so far contrasted: While it lead to relevant findings on M/EEG data, less clear impact was shown when applied to fMRI data. This is mostly due to their poor time resolution and very short duration as well as to the fact that analysis remains performed voxelwise. To take advantage of the large amount of voxels recorded jointly in fMRI, the present contribution proposes the use of a recently introduced Bayesian formalism for multifractal analysis, that regularizes the estimation of the multifractality parameter of a given voxel using information from neighbor voxels. The benefits of this regularized multifractal analysis are illustrated by comparison against classical multifractal analysis on fMRI data collected on one subject, at rest and during a working memory task: Though not yet statistically significant, increased multifractality is observed in task-negative and task-positive networks, respectively.', 'Transcriptome profiling of mouse samples using nanopore sequencing of cDNA and RNA molecules. Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T’s. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T’s, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T’s and therefore concerns more than 20% of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.', 'On Single-Image Super-Resolution in 3D Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The objective of this work is to apply 3D super resolution (SR) techniques to brain magnetic resonance (MR) image restoration. Two 3D SR methods are considered following different trends: one recently proposed tensor-based approach and one inverse problem algorithm based on total variation and low rank regularization. The evaluation of their effectiveness is assessed through the segmentation of brain compartments: gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The two algorithms are qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on simulated images with ground truth available and on experimental data. The originality of this work is to consider the SR methods as an initial step towards the final segmentation task. The results show the ability of both methods to overcome the loss of spatial resolution and to facilitate the segmentation of brain structures with improved accuracy compared to native low-resolution MR images. Both algorithms achieved almost equivalent results with a highly reduced computational time cost for the tensor-based approach.', 'Brain Networks are Independently Modulated by Donepezil, Sleep, and Sleep Deprivation. Resting-state connectivity has been widely studied in the healthy and pathological brain. Less well-characterized are the brain networks altered during pharmacological interventions and their possible interaction with vigilance. In the hopes of finding new biomarkers which can be used to identify cortical activity and cognitive processes linked to the effects of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, the analysis of networks altered by medication would be particularly interesting. Eleven healthy subjects were recruited in the context of the European Innovative Medicines Initiative ‘PharmaCog’. Each underwent five sessions of simultaneous EEG-fMRI in order to investigate the effects of donepezil and memantine before and after sleep deprivation (SD). The SD approach has been previously proposed as a model for cognitive impairment in healthy subjects. By applying network based statistics (NBS), we observed altered brain networks significantly linked to donepezil intake and sleep deprivation. Taking into account the sleep stages extracted from the EEG data we revealed that a network linked to sleep is interacting with sleep deprivation but not with medication intake. We successfully extracted the functional resting-state networks modified by donepezil intake, sleep and SD. We observed donepezil induced whole brain connectivity alterations forming a network separated from the changes induced by sleep and SD, a result which shows the utility of this approach to check for the validity of pharmacological resting-state analysis of the tested medications without the need of taking into account the subject specific vigilance.', 'Spitting out the demons: Extracellular vesicles in glioblastoma. Discovered decades ago, extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerge as dedicated organelles, able to deliver protected, specific cellular cues throughout the organism. While virtually every cell can release EVs, cancer cells co-opted this feature and efficiently unleashed them both in the tumor microenvironment and toward healthy tissues. This might contribute to tumor aggressiveness and spreading. Cancer-derived EVs that contain DNA, mRNA, miRNA, and packed and transmembrane proteins can operate locally or at distance. This review will focus on the high-grade brain tumor (i.e. glioblastoma)-derived EVs, discussing recent reports on i) their phenotype and content, ii) their putative functions, and iii) their clinical potential for improving diagnosis and therapeutics.', \"Evidence-based guidelines on the therapeutic use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A group of European experts was commissioned by the European Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to gather knowledge about the state of the art of the therapeutic use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) from studies published up until September 2016, regarding pain, Parkinson's disease, other movement disorders, motor stroke, poststroke aphasia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, consciousness disorders, Alzheimer's disease, tinnitus, depression, schizophrenia, and craving/addiction. The evidence-based analysis included only studies based on repeated tDCS sessions with sham tDCS control procedure; 25 patients or more having received active treatment was required for Class I, while a lower number of 10–24 patients was accepted for Class II studies. Current evidence does not allow making any recommendation of Level A (definite efficacy) for any indication. Level B recommendation (probable efficacy) is proposed for: (i) anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in fibromyalgia; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in major depressive episode without drug resistance; (iii) anodal tDCS of the right DLPFC (with left DLPFC cathode) in addiction/craving. Level C recommendation (possible efficacy) is proposed for anodal tDCS of the left M1 (or contralateral to pain side, with right orbitofrontal cathode) in chronic lower limb neuropathic pain secondary to spinal cord lesion. Conversely, Level B recommendation (probable inefficacy) is conferred on the absence of clinical effects of: (i) anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in tinnitus; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in drug-resistant major depressive episode. It remains to be clarified whether the probable or possible therapeutic effects of tDCS are clinically meaningful and how to optimally perform tDCS in a therapeutic setting. In addition, the easy management and low cost of tDCS devices allow at home use by the patient, but this might raise ethical and legal concerns with regard to potential misuse or overuse. We must be careful to avoid inappropriate applications of this technique by ensuring rigorous training of the professionals and education of the patients.\", 'Amyloid, tau, and astrocyte pathology in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease variants: AβPParc and PSEN1DE9. Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) may be associated with atypical amyloid beta deposits in the brain. In vivo amyloid imaging using 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) tracer has shown differences in binding between brains from ADAD and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD) patients. To gain further insight into the various pathological characteristics of these genetic variants, we performed large frozen hemisphere autoradiography and brain homogenate binding assays with 3H-PiB, 3H-MK6240-3H-THK5117, and 3H-deprenyl for detection of amyloid fibrils, tau depositions, and activated astrocytes, respectively, in two AβPParc mutation carriers, one PSEN1ΔE9 mutation carrier, and three sAD cases. The results were compared with Abeta 40, Abeta 42, AT8, and GFAP immunostaining, respectively, as well as with Congo red and Bielschowsky. PiB showed a very low binding in AβPParc. A high binding was observed in PSEN1ΔE9 and in sAD tissues but with different binding patterns. Comparable 3H-THK5117 and 3H-deprenyl brain homogenate binding was observed for AβPParc, PSEN1ΔE9, and sAD, respectively. Some differences were observed between 3H-MK6240 and 3H-THK5117 in ADAD. A positive correlation between 3H-deprenyl and 3H-THK5117 binding was observed in AβPParc, while no such correlation was found in PSEN1ΔE9 and sAD. Our study demonstrates differences in the properties of the amyloid plaques between two genetic variants of AD and sAD. Despite the lack of measurable amyloid fibrils by PiB in the AβPParc cases, high regional tau and astrocyte binding was observed. The lack of correlation between 3H-deprenyl and 3H-THK5117 binding in PSEN1ΔE9 and sAD in contrast of the positive correlation observed in the AβPParc cases suggest differences in the pathological cascade between variants of AD that warrant further exploration in vivo.', 'Effective Nanoparticle-Based Nasal Vaccine Against Latent and Congenital Toxoplasmosis in Sheep. Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic protozoan of worldwide distribution, able to infect all warm-blooded animals, but particularly sheep. Primary infection in pregnant sheep leads to millions of abortions and significant economic losses for the livestock industry. Moreover, infected animals constitute the main parasitic reservoir for humans. Therefore, the development of a One-health vaccine seems the best prevention strategy. Following earlier work, a vaccine constituted of total extract of Toxoplasma gondii proteins (TE) associated with maltodextrin nanoparticles (DGNP) was developed in rodents. In this study we evaluated the ability of this vaccine candidate to protect against latent and congenital toxoplasmosis in sheep. After two immunizations by either intranasal or intradermal route, DGNP/TE vaccine generated specific Th1-cellular immune response, mediated by APC-secretion of IFN-γ and IL-12. Secretion of IL-10 appeared to regulate this Th1 response for intradermally vaccinated sheep but was absent in intranasally-vaccinated animals. Finally, protection against latent toxoplasmosis and transplacental transmission were explored. Intranasal vaccination led to a marked decrease of brain cysts compared with the non-vaccinated group. This DGNP/TE vaccine administered intranasally conferred a high level of protection against latent toxoplasmosis and its transplacental transmission in sheep, highlighting the potential for development of such a vaccine for studies in other species.', 'Survey of diagnostic and treatment practices for multiple sclerosis (MS) in Europe. Part 2: Progressive MS, paediatric MS, pregnancy and general management. Background and purpose: The European Charcot Foundation supported the development of a set of surveys to understand current practice patterns for the diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Europe. Part 2 of the report summarizes survey results related to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), pregnancy, paediatric MS and overall patient management. Methods: A steering committee of MS neurologists developed case- and practice-based questions for two sequential surveys distributed to MS neurologists throughout Europe. Results: Respondents generally favoured changing rather than stopping disease-modifying treatment (DMT) in patients transitioning from relapsing−remitting MS to SPMS, particularly with active disease. Respondents would not initiate DMT in patients with typical PPMS symptoms, although the presence of ≥1 spinal cord or brain gadolinium-enhancing lesion might affect that decision. For patients considering pregnancy, respondents were equally divided on whether to stop treatment before or after conception. Respondents strongly favoured starting DMT in paediatric MS with active disease; recommended treatments included interferon, glatiramer acetate and, in John Cunningham virus negative patients, natalizumab. Additional results regarding practice-based questions and management are summarized. Conclusions: Results of part 2 of the survey of diagnostic and treatment practices for MS in Europe largely mirror results for part 1, with neurologists in general agreement about the treatment and management of SPMS, PPMS, pregnancy and paediatric MS as well as the general management of MS. However, there are also many areas of disagreement, indicating the need for evidence-based recommendations and/or guidelines.', 'A functional theory of bistable perception based on dynamical circular inference. When we face ambiguous images, the brain cannot commit to a single percept; instead, it switches between mutually exclusive interpretations every few seconds, a phenomenon known as bistable perception. While neuromechanistic models, e.g., adapting neural populations with lateral inhibition, may account for the dynamics of bistability, a larger question remains unresolved: how this phenomenon informs us on generic perceptual processes in less artificial contexts. Here, we propose that bistable perception is due to our prior beliefs being reverberated in the cortical hierarchy and corrupting the sensory evidence, a phenomenon known as \"circular inference\". Such circularity could occur in a hierarchical brain where sensory responses trigger activity in higher-level areas but are also modulated by feedback projections from these same areas. We show that in the face of ambiguous sensory stimuli, circular inference can change the dynamics of the perceptual system and turn what should be an integrator of inputs into a bistable attractor switching between two highly trusted interpretations. The model captures various aspects of bistability, including Levelt\\'s laws and the stabilizing effects of intermittent presentation of the stimulus. Since it is related to the generic perceptual inference and belief updating mechanisms, this approach can be used to predict the tendency of individuals to form aberrant beliefs from their bistable perception behavior. Overall, we suggest that feedforward/feedback information loops in hierarchical neural networks, a phenomenon that could lead to psychotic symptoms when overly strong, could also underlie perception in nonclinical populations.', \"DBS: a compelling example for ethical and legal reflection-a French perspective on ethical and legal concerns about DBS. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved treatment for neurological diseases and a promising one for psychiatric conditions, which may produce spectacular results very quickly. It is also a powerful tool for brain research and exploration. Beyond an overview of the ethical and legal literature on this topic, this paper aims at showing that DBS is a compelling example for ethical-legal reflection, as it combines a highly technical surgical procedure, a complex active medical device and neuromodulation of the human brain to restore lost abilities caused by a chronic and evolving disease. Some of the ethical and legal issues raised by DBS are not specific, but shed new light on medical ethics and law. Others are more DBS-specific, as they are linked to the intricacies of research and treatment, to the need to tune the device, to the patients' control over the device and its effects and to the involvement of family caregivers.\", 'Genetic identification of cell types underlying brain complex traits yields insights into the etiology of Parkinson’s disease. Genome-wide association studies have discovered hundreds of loci associated with complex brain disorders, but it remains unclear in which cell types these loci are active. Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson’s disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson’s disease.', 'The cognitive reserve should be controlled when using neuroimaging to assess relapse in major depressive disorder. ', 'Missense mutation of Fmr1 results in impaired AMPAR-mediated plasticity and socio-cognitive deficits in mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited intellectual disability and the best-described monogenic cause of autism. CGG-repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene leads to FMR1 silencing, loss-of-expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), and is a common cause of FXS. Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene were also identified in FXS patients, including the recurrent FMRP-R138Q mutation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying FXS caused by this mutation, we generated a knock-in mouse model (Fmr1R138Q) expressing the FMRP-R138Q protein. We demonstrate that, in the hippocampus of the Fmr1R138Q mice, neurons show an increased spine density associated with synaptic ultrastructural defects and increased AMPA receptor-surface expression. Combining biochemical assays, high-resolution imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioural testing, we also show that the R138Q mutation results in impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and socio-cognitive deficits in mice. These findings reveal the functional impact of the FMRP-R138Q mutation in a mouse model of FXS.', 'Altered Cerebro-Cerebellar Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Alcohol Use Disorder: a Resting-State fMRI Study. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is widely associated with cerebellar dysfunction and altered cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) that lead to cognitive impairments. Evidence for this association comes from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies that assess time-averaged measures of FC across the duration of a typical scan. This approach, however, precludes the assessment of potentially FC dynamics happening at faster timescales. In this study, using rsfMRI data, we aim at exploring cerebro-cerebellar FC dynamics in AUD patients (N = 18) and age- and sex-matched controls (N = 18). In particular, we quantified group-level differences in the temporal variability of FC between the posterior cerebellum and large-scale cognitive systems, and we investigated the role of the cerebellum in large-scale brain dynamics in terms of the temporal flexibility and integration of its regions. We found that, relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited significantly greater FC variability between the cerebellum and both the frontoparietal executive control (F1,31 = 7.01, p(FDR) = 0.028) and ventral attention (F1,31 = 7.35, p(FDR) = 0.028) networks. Moreover, the AUD group exhibited significantly less flexibility (F1,31 = 8.61, p(FDR) = 0.028) and greater integration (F1,31 = 9.11, p(FDR) = 0.028) in the cerebellum. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we found distributed changes in the dynamics of canonical large-scale networks in AUD. Overall, this study brings evidence of AUD-related alterations in dynamic FC within major cerebro-cerebellar networks. This pattern has implications for explaining the development and maintenance of this disorder and improving our understating of the cerebellum’s involvement in addiction.', 'Prevalence of amyloid-β pathology in distinct variants of primary progressive aphasia. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-β pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models. Results: Amyloid-β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86%) than in nfvPPA (20%) or svPPA (16%; p < 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-β positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10% at age 50 years to 27% at age 80 years, p < 0.01) and svPPA (from 6% at age 50 years to 32% at age 80 years, p < 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often amyloid-β positive (58.0%) than noncarriers (35.0%, p < 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP-43 in svPPA (80%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64%). Interpretation: This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid-β biomarkers in PPA patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:737–748.', 'Autophagy and brain: The case of neurodegenerative diseases. The autophagy-lysosome system is an essential pathway to get rid of unwanted cellular components (proteins and organelles). The brain, and specifically neurons, are very sensitive to abnormalities of the proteome because altered proteins or damaged organelles cannot be diluted by cell division that does not occur in these cells. Most neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by accumulation of undegraded misfolded proteins and are currently associated with autophagy-lysosome dysfunctions. Recent studies have highlighted the modulation of this complex pathway as a putative therapeutic strategy. This review provides an update on the brain-related specificities and dysfunctions of this pathway and discusses the autophagy-based therapies couteracting neurodegeneration.', 'Structural constraints of functional connectivity drive cognitive impairment in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. Background: The relationship between structural and functional deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS) is unclear. Objective: This study explored structure-function relationships during the 5 years following a clinically isolated syndrome and their role in cognitive performance. Methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled after their first neurological episode suggestive of MS and followed for 5 years, along with 10 matched healthy controls. We assessed structural (using diffusion tensor imaging) and functional (using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) brain network metrics, clinical and cognitive scores at each follow-up visit. Structural–functional coupling, calculated as the correlation coefficient between strengths of structural and functional networks, was used to assess structure–function relationships. Results: Structural clustering coefficient was significantly increased after 5 years, whereas characteristic path length decreased. Structural connections decreased after 1 year and increased after 5 years. Functional connections and related path lengths were decreased after 5 years. Structural–functional coupling had increased significantly after 5 years. This structural–functional coupling was associated with cognitive and clinical evolution, with stronger coupling associated with a decline in both domains. Conclusion: Our findings provide novel biological evidence that MS leads to a more constrained anatomical-dependant functional connectivity. The collapse of this network seems to lead to both cognitive worsening and clinical disability.', 'Discovering the individual brain: brain stimulation in psychiatry: Editorial I to the supplement from the 2nd European conference on brain stimulation in psychiatry.

Inflammation may play a role in the development of epilepsy after brain insults. [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binds to TSPO, expressed by activated microglia. We quantified [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binding during epileptogenesis after pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus (SE), a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Nine male rats were studied thrice (D0-1, D0+6, D0+35, D0=SE induction). In the same session, 7T T2-weighted images and DTI for mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were acquired, followed by dynamic PET/ CT. On D0+35, femoral arterial blood was sampled for rat-specific metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input functions (AIFs). In multiple MR-derived ROIs, we assessed four kinetic models (two with AIFs; two using a reference region), standard uptake values (SUVs), and a model with a mean AIF. All models showed large (up to two-fold) and significant TSPO binding increases in regions expected to be affected, and comparatively little change in the brainstem, at D0+6. Some individuals showed increases at D0+35. AIF models yielded more consistent increases at D0+6. FA values were decreased at D0+6 and had recovered by D0+35. MD was increased at D0+6 and more so at D0+35. [11C]-(R)-PK11195 PET binding and MR biomarker changes could be detected with only nine rats, highlighting the potential of longitudinal imaging studies.', 'Nutrition and the ageing brain: Moving towards clinical applications. The global increases in life expectancy and population have resulted in a growing ageing population and with it a growing number of people living with age-related neurodegenerative conditions and dementia, shifting focus towards methods of prevention, with lifestyle approaches such as nutrition representing a promising avenue for further development. This overview summarises the main themes discussed during the 3rd Symposium on “Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Moving Towards Clinical Applications” held in Madrid in August 2018, enlarged with the current state of knowledge on how nutrition influences healthy ageing and gives recommendations regarding how the critical field of nutrition and neurodegeneration research should move forward into the future. Specific nutrients are discussed as well as the impact of multi-nutrient and whole diet approaches, showing particular promise to combatting the growing burden of age-related cognitive decline. The emergence of new avenues for exploring the role of diet in healthy ageing, such as the impact of the gut microbiome and development of new techniques (imaging measures of brain metabolism, metabolomics, biomarkers) are enabling researchers to approach finding answers to these questions. But the translation of these findings into clinical and public health contexts remains an obstacle due to significant shortcomings in nutrition research or pressure on the scientific community to communicate recommendations to the general public in a convincing and accessible way. Some promising programs exist but further investigation to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which nutrition can improve brain health across the human lifespan is still required.', 'Stroke-like events after brain radiotherapy: a large series with long-term follow-up. Background and purpose: Patients with a history of brain radiotherapy can experience acute stroke-like syndromes related to the delayed effects of brain radiation, including stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy syndrome, peri-ictal pseudoprogression and acute late-onset encephalopathy after radiation therapy syndrome. The aim of this study was to collect evidence on the long-term outcome and treatment of these conditions, whose knowledge is undermined by their rarity and fragmented description. Methods: Cases were collected, both prospectively and retrospectively, amongst six neuro-oncology departments. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) history of brain radiotherapy (completed at least 6\\xa0months before the acute episode); (ii) new onset of acute/subacute neurological symptoms; (iii) exclusion of all etiologies unrelated to brain irradiation. A review of current literature on stroke-like syndromes was performed to corroborate our findings. Results: Thirty-two patients with acute neurological conditions attributed to the delayed effects of radiation were identified, including 26 patients with stroke-like syndromes. Patients with stroke-like syndromes commonly presented with a mosaic of symptoms, including focal deficits (77%), encephalopathy (50%), seizures (35%) and headache (35%). Seventy-three percent of them had acute consistent magnetic resonance imaging alterations. Treatment included high-dose steroids in 65% of cases. Twenty-two patients recovered completely (85%). Sixteen patients (62%) experienced relapses (median follow-up 3.5\\xa0years). A literature review identified 87 additional stroke-like cases with similar characteristics. Conclusions: Stroke-like events related to brain irradiation may be associated with permanent sequelae. Steroids are often administered on empirical grounds, as they are thought to accelerate recovery. Relapses are common, highlighting the need to elaborate adequate prevention strategies.', 'Opto nongenetics inhibition of neuronal firing. Optogenetics is based on the selective expression of exogenous opsins by neurons allowing experimental control of their electrical activity using visible light. The interpretation of the results of optogenetic experiments is based on the assumption that light stimulation selectively acts on those neurons expressing the exogenous opsins without perturbing the activity of naive ones. Here, we report that light stimulation, of wavelengths and power in the range of those normally used in optogenetic experiments, consistently reduces the firing activity of naive Mitral Cells (MCs) and Tufted Neurons in the olfactory bulb as well as in Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs) in the striatum. No such effect was observed for cerebellar Purkinje and hippocampal CA1 neurons. The effects on MC firing appear to be mainly due to a light-induced increase in tissue temperature, between 0.1 and 0.4°C, associated with the generation of a hyperpolarizing current and a modification of action potential (AP) shape. Therefore, light in the visible range can affect neuronal physiology in a cell-specific manner. Beside the implications for optogenetic studies, our results pave the way to investigating the use of visible light for therapeutic purposes in pathologies associated with neuronal hyperexcitability.', 'Altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis induces Calpain- Cathepsin axis activation in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most prevalent form of human prion disease and it is characterized by the presence of neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, chronic inflammation and the accumulation of misfolded and pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc). The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations are largely unknown, but the presence of intracellular neuronal calcium (Ca2+) overload, a general feature in models of prion diseases, is suggested to play a key role in prion pathogenesis. Here we describe the presence of massive regulation of Ca2+ responsive genes in sCJD brain tissue, accompanied by two Ca2+-dependent processes: endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of the cysteine proteases Calpains 1/2. Pathogenic Calpain proteins activation in sCJD is linked to the cleavage of their cellular substrates, impaired autophagy and lysosomal damage, which is partially reversed by Calpain inhibition in a cellular prion model. Additionally, Calpain 1 treatment enhances seeding activity of PrPSc in a prion conversion assay. Neuronal lysosomal impairment caused by Calpain over activation leads to the release of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin S that in sCJD mainly localises in axons, although massive Cathepsin S overexpression is detected in microglial cells. Alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis and activation of Calpain-Cathepsin axis already occur at pre-clinical stages of the disease as detected in a humanized sCJD mouse model. Altogether our work indicates that unbalanced Calpain-Cathepsin activation is a relevant contributor to the pathogenesis of sCJD at multiple molecular levels and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.', 'Pseudoneglect in line bisection judgement is associated with a modulation of right hemispheric spatial attention dominance in right-handers. The objective of this study was to validate a line bisection judgement (LBJ) task for use in investigating the lateralized cerebral bases of spatial attention in a sample of 51 right-handed healthy participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants performed a LBJ task that was compared to a visuomotor control task during which the participants made similar saccadic and motoric responses. Cerebral lateralization was determined using a voxel-based functional asymmetry analysis and a hemispheric functional lateralization index (HFLI) computed from fMRI contrast images. Behavioural attentional deviation biases were assessed during the LBJ task and a “paper and pencil” symbol cancellation task (SCT). Individual visuospatial skills were also evaluated. The results showed that both the LBJ and SCT tasks elicited leftward spatial biases in healthy subjects, although the biases were not correlated, which indicated their independence. Neuroimaging results showed that the LBJ task elicited a right hemispheric lateralization, with rightward asymmetries found in a large posterior occipito-parietal area, the posterior calcarine sulcus (V1p) and the temporo-occipital junction (TOJ) and in the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior insula and the superior medial frontal gyrus. The comparison of the LBJ asymmetry map to the lesion map of neglect patients who suffer line bisection deviation demonstrated maximum overlap in a network that included the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), the TOJ, the anterior insula and the inferior frontal region, likely subtending spatial LBJ bias. Finally, the LBJ task-related cerebral lateralization was specifically correlated with the LBJ spatial bias but not with the SCT bias or with the visuospatial skills of the participants. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the LBJ task is adequate for investigating spatial lateralization in healthy subjects and is suitable for determining the factors underlying the variability of spatial cerebral lateralization.', \"Cognitive and imaging markers in non-demented subjects attending a memory clinic: Study design and baseline findings of the MEMENTO cohort. Background: The natural history and disease mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are still poorly understood. Very few resources are available to scrutinise patients as early as needed and to use integrative approaches combining standardised, repeated clinical investigations and cutting-edge biomarker measurements. Methods: In the nationwide French MEMENTO cohort study, participants were recruited in memory clinics and screened for either isolated subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; defined as test performance 1.5 SD below age, sex and education-level norms) while not demented (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] <1). Baseline data collection included neurological and physical examinations as well as extensive neuropsychological testing. To be included in the MEMENTO cohort, participants had to agree to undergo both brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sampling. Cerebral 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positon emission tomography and lumbar puncture were optional. Automated analyses of cerebral MRI included assessments of volumes of whole-brain, hippocampal and white matter lesions. Results: The 2323 participants, recruited from April 2011 to June 2014, were aged 71 years, on average (SD 8.7), and 62% were women. CDR was 0 in 40% of participants, and 30% carried at least one apolipoprotein E ϵ4 allele. We observed that more than half (52%) of participants had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (17% single-domain aMCI), 32% had non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (16.9% single-domain naMCI) and 16% had isolated SCCs. Multivariable analyses of neuroimaging markers associations with cognitive categories showed that participants with aMCI had worse levels of imaging biomarkers than the others, whereas participants with naMCI had markers at intermediate levels between SCC and aMCI. The burden of white matter lesions tended to be larger in participants with aMCI. Independently of CDR, all neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers worsened with age, whereas differences were not consistent according to sex. Conclusions: MEMENTO is a large cohort with extensive clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data and represents a platform for studying the natural history of ADRD in a large group of participants with different subtypes of MCI (amnestic or not amnestic) or isolated SCCs.

Functional connectivity analyses of fMRI data have shown that the activity of the brain at rest is spatially organized into resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs appear as groups of anatomically distant but functionally tightly connected brain regions. Inter-RSN intrinsic connectivity analyses may provide an optimal spatial level of integration to analyze the variability of the functional connectome. Here we propose a deep learning approach to enable the automated classification of individual independent-component (IC) decompositions into a set of predefined RSNs. Two databases were used in this work, BIL&GIN and MRi-Share, with 427 and 1811 participants, respectively. We trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify each IC as one of 45 RSNs, using the IC classification of 282 participants in BIL&GIN for training and a 5-dimensional parameter grid search for hyperparameter optimization. It reached an accuracy of 92 %. Predictions for the remaining individuals in BIL&GIN were tested against the original classification and demonstrated good spatial overlap between the cortical RSNs. As a first application, we created an RSN atlas based on MRi-Share. This atlas defined a brain parcellation in 29 RSNs covering 96 % of the gray matter. Second, we proposed an individual-based analysis of the subdivision of the default-mode network into 4 networks. Minimal overlap between RSNs was found except in the angular gyrus and potentially in the precuneus. We thus provide the community with an individual IC classifier that can be used to analyze one dataset or to statistically compare different datasets for RSN spatial definitions.', 'Optical coherence tomography in multiple sclerosis: A 3-year prospective multicenter study. Objective: To evaluate changes over 3 years in the thickness of inner retinal layers including the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), and combined macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers (mGCIPL), in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) versus healthy controls; to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) is sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to detect small degrees of neuroaxonal loss over time that correlate with changes in brain volume and disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Methods: Individuals with RRMS from 28 centers (n = 333) were matched with 64 healthy participants. OCT scans were performed on Heidelberg Spectralis machines (at baseline; 1 month; 6 months; 6-monthly thereafter). Results: OCT measurements were highly reproducible between baseline and 1 month (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.98). Significant inner retinal layer thinning was observed in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with controls regardless of previous MS-associated optic neuritis––group differences (95% CI) over 3 years: pRNFL: −1.86 (−2.54, −1.17) µm; mGCIPL: −2.03 (−2.78, −1.28) µm (both p < 0.0001; effect sizes 0.39 and 0.34). Greater inner retinal layer atrophy was observed in individuals diagnosed with RRMS <3 years versus >5 years (pRNFL: p < 0.05; mGCIPL: p < 0.01). Brain volume decreased by 1.3% in individuals with MS over 3 years compared to 0.5% in control subjects (effect size 0.76). mGCIPL atrophy correlated with brain atrophy (p < 0.0001). There was no correlation of OCT data with disability progression. Interpretation: OCT has potential to estimate rates of neurodegeneration in the retina and brain. The effect size for OCT, smaller than for magnetic resonance imaging based on Heidelberg Spectralis data acquired in this study, was increased in early disease.', 'Typical and atypical language brain organization based on intrinsic connectivity and multitask functional asymmetries. Based on the joint investigation in 287 healthy volunteers (150 left-Handers (LH)) of language task-induced asymmetries and intrinsic connectivity strength of the sentence-processing supramodal network, we show that individuals with atypical rightward language lateralization (N = 30, 25 LH) do not rely on an organization that simply mirrors that of typical leftward lateralized individuals. Actually, the resting-state organization in the atypicals showed that their sentence processing was underpinned by left and right networks both wired for language processing and highly interacting by strong interhemispheric intrinsic connectivity and larger corpus callosum volume. Such a loose hemispheric specialization for language permits the hosting of language in either the left and/or right hemisphere as assessed by a very high incidence of dissociations across various language task-induced asymmetries in this group.', 'Arterial hypertension with multiple organ damage: A new entity?. Hypertensive emergency. Stable incidence for several decades or even increasing (under diagnosed). Early and specific management improves prognosis. Absence of eye damage or lack of access to fundus should not delay or prevent the diagnosis. Multi Organ Damage Hypertension: new definition for an old entity: unusual, sudden and persistent blood pressure rise without threshold and ocular involvement or involvement of at least 3 target organs among brain, heart, kidney or endothelial disease.', 'Rare Case of Giant Supratentorial Dermoid Cyst. Background: Dermoid cysts are benign, congenital rare lesions, frequently occurring in or near the midline. Rare localizations and variable radiologic findings have been described but remain exceptional. Case Description: The authors present a rare case of a giant temporoparietal dermoid cyst in an adult female who was paucisymptomatic. No sign of rupture was identified, with a clinical presentation suggesting a slow-growing lesion. Gross total excision was performed with a favorable clinical and radiologic outcome. Conclusions: Rare localizations previously published in the literature are discussed for dermoid cysts. To our best knowledge, this is the first giant dermoid cyst presenting with this localization.', 'Long-Term Vascular Outcomes in Patients With Mixed Location Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Microbleeds. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mixed location intracerebral hemorrhages/microbleeds (mixed ICH) is a risk factor for vascular unfavorable outcome compared to cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related ICH (CAA-ICH) or strictly deep hypertensive ICH/microbleeds (HTN-ICH). METHODS: A total of 300 patients with spontaneous ICH were included. Clinical data, neuroimaging markers, and follow-up outcomes (recurrent ICH, ischemic stroke, and vascular death) were compared among mixed ICH (n = 148), CAA-ICH (n = 32), and HTN-ICH (n = 120). The association between follow-up events and neuroimaging markers was explored using multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Patients with mixed ICH were older (65.6 ± 12.1 years vs 58.1 ± 13.3 years, p < 0.001) than patients with HTN-ICH, but younger than patients with CAA-ICH (73.3 ± 13.8 years, p = 0.001). Compared to CAA-ICH, mixed ICH had similar incidence of vascular events (all p > 0.05). Compared to HTN-ICH, mixed ICH is associated with higher ICH recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-7.7), more ischemic stroke (HR 8.2, 95% CI 1.0-65.8), and vascular composite outcome (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.2) after adjustment for age and sex. In patients with mixed ICH, the presence of cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) is associated the development of ICH recurrence (HR 4.8, 95% CI 1.0-23.2), ischemic stroke (HR 8.8, 95% CI 1.7-45.5), and vascular composite outcome (HR 6.2, 95% CI 1.9-20.2). The association between cSS and ischemic stroke (p = 0.01) or vascular composite outcome (p = 0.003) remained significant after further adjustment for other radiologic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed ICH harbors higher risk of unfavorable vascular outcome than HTN-ICH. Presence of cSS in mixed ICH independently predicts vascular event, suggesting the contribution of detrimental effect due to coexisting CAA.', '<sup>18</sup>F-F13640 preclinical evaluation in rodent, cat and primate as a 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor agonist for PET neuroimaging. Serotonin 1A receptors are known to play an important role in many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, all available 5-HT1A receptor PET radiopharmaceuticals that are radiolabeled with fluorine-18 are antagonists. As agonists bind preferentially to the high-affinity state of receptors, it would be of great interest to develop agonist radioligands which could provide a measure of the functional 5-HT1A receptors in pathophysiological processes. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist candidates we recently proposed had promising in vitro properties but were not optimal in terms of PET imaging. F13640, a.k.a befiradol or NLX-112, is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist with a high affinity (Ki = 1\\xa0nM) and a high selectivity that would be suitable for a potential PET radiopharmaceutical. With propose here the first preclinical evaluation of 18F-F13640. 18F-F13640’s nitro-precursor was synthesized and radiolabeled via a fluoro-nucleophilic substitution. Its radiopharmacological characterization included autoradiographic studies, metabolic studies, and in vivo PET scans in rat, cat and non-human primate. Some of the results were compared with the radiotracer 18F-MPPF, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. The radiochemical purity of 18F-F13640 was > 98%. In vitro binding pattern was consistent with the 5-HT1A receptor distribution. Metabolic studies revealed that the radiotracer rapidly entered the brain and led to few brain radiometabolites. Although 18F-F13640 in vivo binding was blocked by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 and the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT, the distribution pattern was markedly different from antagonist radiotracers in the three species, suggesting it provides novel information on 5-HT1A receptors. Preliminary studies also suggest a high sensitivity of 18F-F13640 to endogenous serotonin release. 18F-F13640 has suitable characteristics for probing in vitro and in vivo the 5-HT1A receptors in high-affinity state. Quantification analyses with kinetic modeling are in progress to prepare the first-in-man study of 18F-F13640.', 'Fast therapeutic hypothermia prevents post-cardiac arrest syndrome through cyclophilin D-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition inhibition. The opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), which is regulated by the matrix protein cyclophilin D (CypD), plays a key role in the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest (CA) syndrome. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia could prevent post-CA syndrome through a CypD-mediated PTP inhibition in both heart and brain. In addition, we investigated whether specific pharmacological PTP inhibition would confer additive protection to cooling. Adult male New Zealand White rabbits underwent 15\\xa0min of CA followed by 120\\xa0min of reperfusion. Five groups (n\\xa0=\\xa010–15/group) were studied: control group (CA\\xa0only), hypothermia group (HT, hypothermia at 32–34\\xa0°C induced by external cooling at reperfusion), NIM group (injection at reperfusion of 2.5\\xa0mg/kg NIM811, a specific CypD inhibitor), HT\\xa0+\\xa0NIM, and sham group. The following measurements were taken: hemodynamics, echocardiography, and cellular damage markers (including S100β protein and troponin Ic). Oxidative phosphorylation and PTP opening were assessed on mitochondria isolated from both brain and heart. Acetylation of CypD was measured by immunoprecipitation in both the cerebral cortex and myocardium. Hypothermia and NIM811 significantly prevented cardiovascular dysfunction, pupillary areflexia, and early tissue damage. Hypothermia and NIM811 preserved oxidative phosphorylation, limited PTP opening in both brain and heart mitochondria and prevented increase in CypD acetylation in brain. There were no additive beneficial effects in the combination of NIM811 and therapeutic hypothermia. In conclusion, therapeutic hypothermia limited post-CA syndrome by preventing mitochondrial permeability transition mainly through a CypD-dependent mechanism.', 'Contribution of Clinical Neuroimaging to the Understanding of the Pharmacology of Methylphenidate. Methylphenidate (MPH) is currently the most widely used molecule in the pharmacologic treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although experience of its application now extends over several decades, its psychotropic nature, prolonged use in children, and chemical relation to amphetamines still raise doubts in the minds of prescribers and the families of the patients. Brain imaging has shed considerable light on the neuropharmacology of MPH. The two main in vivo neuroimaging techniques are positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and these can be applied in both animal models and humans. The present review seeks to show how human molecular and functional imaging has contributed to determining not only the molecular targets of MPH, and the action kinetics of the various pharmaceutical forms available, but also the connectivity and brain networks activated by treatment. We also discuss the perspectives opened up by new hybrid PET–MRI techniques that enable multimodal tracking of the impact of methylphenidate on neurotransmission.', 'Neurophysiological assessment of brain dysfunction in critically ill patients: an update. The aim of this review was to provide up-to-date information about the usefulness of clinical neurophysiology testing in the management of critically ill patients. Evoked potentials (EPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) are non-invasive clinical neurophysiology tools that allow an objective assessment of the central nervous system’s function at the bedside in intensive care unit (ICU). These tests are quite useful in diagnosing cerebral complications, and establishing the vital and functional prognosis in ICU. EEG keeps a particularly privileged importance in detecting seizures phenomena such as subclinical seizures and non-convulsive status epilepticus. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) analysis techniques commonly called EEG Brain mapping can provide obvious topographic displays of digital EEG signals characteristics, showing the potential distribution over the entire scalp including filtering, frequency, and amplitude analysis and color mapping. Evidences of usefulness of QEEG for seizures detection in ICU are provided by several recent studies. Furthermore, beyond detection of epileptic phenomena, changes of some QEEG panels are early warning indicators of sedation level as well as brain damage or dysfunction in ICU. EPs offer the opportunity for assessing brainstem’s functional integrity, as well as subcortical and cortical brain areas. A multimodal use, combining EEG and various modalities of EPs is recommended since this allows a more accurate functional exploration of the brain and helps caregivers to tailor therapeutic measures according to neurological worsening trends and to anticipate the prognosis in ICU.', 'Structural-functional brain changes in depressed patients during and after electroconvulsive therapy. Objectives Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-pharmacological treatment that is effective in treating severe and treatment-resistant depression. Although the efficacy of ECT has been demonstrated to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), the brain mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Structural-functional changes occur with the use of ECT as a treatment for depression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For this reason, we have tried to identify the changes that were identified by MRI to try to clarify some operating mechanisms of ECT. We focus to brain changes on MRI [structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imging (DTI)] after ECT. Methods A systematic search of the international literature was performed using the bibliographic search engines PubMed and Embase. The research focused on papers published up to 30 September 2015. The following Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms were used: Electroconvulsive therapy AND (MRI OR fMRI OR DTI). Papers published in English were included. Four authors searched the database using a predefined strategy to identify potentially eligible studies. Results There were structural changes according to the sMRI performed before and after ECT treatment. These changes do not seem to be entirely due to oedema. This investigation assessed the functional network connectivity associated with the ECT response in MDD. ECT response reverses the relationship from negative to positive between the two pairs of networks. Conclusion We found structural-functional changes in MRI post-ECT. Because of the currently limited MRI data on ECT in the literature, it is necessary to conduct further investigations using other MRI technology.', '3rd European Conference on brain stimulation in psychiatry – From mechanism to medicine. ', 'Structural Imaging in Parkinson’s Disease: New Developments. Purpose of Review: To review the advances in structural imaging for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) during the last 5\\xa0years. Recent Findings: Structural imaging using high-field MRI (≥ 3\\xa0T) and new MR sequences sensitive to iron and nigral pigments have achieved to assess in vivo pathological surrogates useful for PD diagnosis (notably decreased nigral neuromelanin and loss of dorsal nigral hyperintensity, increased nigral iron content, diffusivity, and free-water), prodromal diagnosis (decreased neuromelanin signal in the locus coeruleus), and PD progression (with increasing nigral iron content (increasing R2* rate) and nigral damage (increasing free-water)). Additionally, evaluation of atrophy in small monoaminergic nuclei is useful for prognosis, including cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei atrophy for cognitive impairment. Summary: New advances in multimodal structural imaging improve diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of invasive treatment outcome in PD, and may further benefit from machine learning and large scale longitudinal studies to better identify prognostic subtypes.', 'Developmental differences in the expression of ABC transporters at rat brain barrier interfaces following chronic exposure to diallyl sulfide. Many pregnant women and prematurely born infants require medication for clinical conditions including cancer, cardiac defects and psychiatric disorders. In adults drug transfer from blood into brain is mostly restricted by efflux mechanisms (ATP-binding cassette, ABC transporters). These mechanisms have been little studied during brain development. Here expression of eight ABC transporters (abcb1a, abcb1b, abcg2, abcc1, abcc2, abcc3, abcc4, abcc5) and activity of conjugating enzyme glutathione-s-transferase (GST) were measured in livers, brain cortices (blood-brain-barrier) and choroid plexuses (blood-cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, barrier) during postnatal rat development. Controls were compared to animals chronically injected (4 days, 200 mg/kg/day) with known abcb1a inducer diallyl sulfide (DAS). Results reveal both tissue- and age-dependent regulation. In liver abcb1a and abcc3 were up-regulated at all ages. In cortex abcb1a/b, abcg2 and abcc4/abcc5 were up-regulated in adults only, while in choroid plexus abcb1a and abcc2 were up-regulated only at P14. DAS treatment increased GST activity in livers, but not in cortex or choroid plexuses. Immunocytochemistry of ABC transporters at the CSF-brain interface showed that PGP and BCRP predominated in neuroepithelium while MRP2/4/5 were prominent in adult ependyma. These results indicate an age-related capacity of brain barriers to dynamically regulate their defence mechanisms when chronically challenged by xenobiotic compounds.', 'Mutations in TRAPPC11 are associated with a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a heterogeneous and rapidly growing group of diseases caused by abnormal glycosylation of proteins and/or lipids. Mutations in genes involved in the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus (GA), and the vesicular trafficking from the ER to the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) have been found to be associated with CDG. Here, we report a patient with defects in both N- and O-glycosylation combined with a delayed vesicular transport in the GA due to mutations in TRAPPC11, a subunit of the TRAPPIII complex. TRAPPIII is implicated in the anterograde transport from the ER to the ERGIC as well as in the vesicle export from the GA. This report expands the spectrum of genetic alterations associated with CDG, providing new insights for the diagnosis and the understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms underlying glycosylation disorders.', 'Impact of collateral status on neuroprotective effect of cyclosporine a in acute ischemic stroke. Background: Neuroprotection for acute ischemic stroke remains an elusive goal. Intracranial collaterals may favor neuroprotective drugs delivery at the acute stage of ischemic stroke. A recent phase 2 study showed that cyclosporine A (CsA) reduced ischemic damage in patients with a proximal occlusion who experienced effective recanalization. Collateral flow may improve this benefit. Materials & Methods: Collateral supply was assessed using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI in 47 patients among the 110 patients from the original study and were graded in two groups: good collaterals and poor collaterals. Patients with good collaterals had significantly smaller initial infarct in both CsA group (p = 0.003) and controls (p = 0.016). Similarly, the final lesion volume was significantly lower in patients with good collaterals in both groups. Results: In patients with either good or poor collaterals CsA showed no additional benefit on ischemic lesion progression and final infarct size at day 30. Conclusion: We failed to demonstrate any significant additional benefit of CsA in patients with good collateral circulation.', \"Brain Volume Predicts Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease. Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are frequent and troublesome for patients and caregivers. Considering possible preventive approaches, a better understanding of underlying neural correlates of BPSD is crucial. Objective: The aim is to assess whether brain regional volume predicts behavioral changes in mild AD. Methods: This work took part from the PACO study, a multicenter and prospective study that included 252 patients with mild AD from 2009 to 2014. Fifty-three patients were retained. Forty healthy matched control subjects from the ADNI cohort were included as controls. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to assess regional brain volume using baseline MRI scans as a predictor of future behavioral changes over a period of 18 months. Behavior was assessed at baseline and longitudinally at 6-month intervals using the shortened form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Results: The volume of 23 brain structures in frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, subcortical regions and cerebellum predicted the evolution of NPI scores. Frontal volume was the most powerful predictor with frontal gyri, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbital gyri being particularly involved. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing regional brain volumes as predictors of behavioral changes considered at earlier stages of AD. Up to 23 brain structures were associated with an increased risk of developing BPSD. Frontal lobe volume was the strongest predictor of future evolution of NPI. The involvement of multiple structures in the prediction of behavior suggests a role of the main large-scale networks involved in cognition.\", 'Decoding across sensory modalities reveals common supramodal signatures of conscious perception. An increasing number of studies highlight common brain regions and processes in mediating conscious sensory experience. While most studies have been performed in the visual modality, it is implicitly assumed that similar processes are involved in other sensory modalities. However, the existence of supramodal neural processes related to conscious perception has not been convincingly shown so far. Here, we aim to directly address this issue by investigating whether neural correlates of conscious perception in one modality can predict conscious perception in a different modality. In two separate experiments, we presented participants with successive blocks of near-threshold tasks involving subjective reports of tactile, visual, or auditory stimuli during the same magnetoencephalography (MEG) acquisition. Using decoding analysis in the poststimulus period between sensory modalities, our first experiment uncovered supramodal spatiotemporal neural activity patterns predicting conscious perception of the feeble stimulation. Strikingly, these supramodal patterns included activity in primary sensory regions not directly relevant to the task (e.g., neural activity in visual cortex predicting conscious perception of auditory near-threshold stimulation). We carefully replicate our results in a control experiment that furthermore show that the relevant patterns are independent of the type of report (i.e., whether conscious perception was reported by pressing or withholding a button press). Using standard paradigms for probing neural correlates of conscious perception, our findings reveal a common signature of conscious access across sensory modalities and illustrate the temporally late and widespread broadcasting of neural representations, even into task-unrelated primary sensory processing regions.', 'Refinement of the Primate Corticospinal Pathway during Prenatal Development. Perturbation of the developmental refinement of the corticospinal (CS) pathway leads to motor disorders. While non-primate developmental refinement is well documented, in primates invasive investigations of the developing CS pathway have been confined to neonatal and postnatal stages when refinement is relatively modest. Here, we investigated the developmental changes in the distribution of CS projection neurons in cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Injections of retrograde tracer at cervical levels of the spinal cord at embryonic day (E) 95 and E105 show that: (i) areal distribution of back-labeled neurons is more extensive than in the neonate and dense labeling is found in prefrontal, limbic, temporal, and occipital cortex; (ii) distributions of contralateral and ipsilateral projecting CS neurons are comparable in terms of location and numbers of labeled neurons, in contrast to the adult where the contralateral projection is an order of magnitude higher than the ipsilateral projection. Findings from one largely restricted injection suggest a hitherto unsuspected early innervation of the gray matter. In the fetus there was in addition dense labeling in the central nucleus of the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the adjacent region of the zona incerta, subcortical structures with only minor projections in the adult control.', \"AMP-activated protein kinase modulates tau phosphorylation and tau pathology in vivo. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases commonly known as tauopathies. NFTs result from the intracellular aggregation of abnormally and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Tau functions, which include the regulation of microtubules dynamics, are dependent on its phosphorylation status. As a consequence, any changes in tau phosphorylation can have major impacts on synaptic plasticity and memory. Recently, it has been demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was deregulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients where it co-localized with phosphorylated tau in pre-tangle and tangle-bearing neurons. Besides, it was found that AMPK was a tau kinase in vitro. Here, we find that endogenous AMPK activation in mouse primary neurons induced an increase of tau phosphorylation at multiple sites, whereas AMPK inhibition led to a rapid decrease of tau phosphorylation. We further show that AMPK mice deficient for one of the catalytic alpha subunits displayed reduced endogenous tau phosphorylation. Finally, we found that AMPK deficiency reduced tau pathology in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. These results show that AMPK regulates tau phosphorylation in mouse primary neurons as well as in vivo, and thus suggest that AMPK could be a key player in the development of AD pathology.\", 'The reliability of a deep learning model in clinical out-of-distribution MRI data: A multicohort study. Deep learning (DL) methods have in recent years yielded impressive results in medical imaging, with the potential to function as clinical aid to radiologists. However, DL models in medical imaging are often trained on public research cohorts with images acquired with a single scanner or with strict protocol harmonization, which is not representative of a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen clinical datasets–collected with different scanners, protocols and disease populations–and whether more heterogeneous training data improves generalization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple dementia research cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually rated by a neuroradiologist according to Scheltens’ scale of medial temporal atrophy (MTA), were included in this study. By training multiple versions of a convolutional neural network on different subsets of this data to predict MTA ratings, we assessed the impact of including images from a wider distribution during training had on performance in external memory clinic data. Our results showed that our model generalized well to datasets acquired with similar protocols as the training data, but substantially worse in clinical cohorts with visibly different tissue contrasts in the images. This implies that future DL studies investigating performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) MRI data need to assess multiple external cohorts for reliable results. Further, by including data from a wider range of scanners and protocols the performance improved in OOD data, which suggests that more heterogeneous training data makes the model generalize better. To conclude, this is the most comprehensive study to date investigating the domain shift in deep learning on MRI data, and we advocate rigorous evaluation of DL models on clinical data prior to being certified for deployment.', 'TBC1D24 genotype-phenotype correlation. Objective: To evaluate the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in TBC1D24. Methods: We acquired new clinical, EEG, and neuroimaging data of 11 previously unreported and 37 published patients. TBC1D24 mutations, identified through various sequencing methods, can be found online (http://lovd.nl/TBC1D24). Results: Forty-eight patients were included (28 men, 20 women, average age 21 years) from 30 independent families. Eighteen patients (38%) had myoclonic epilepsies. The other patients carried diagnoses of focal (25%), multifocal (2%), generalized (4%), and unclassified epilepsy (6%), and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (25%). Most patients had drug-resistant epilepsy. We detail EEG, neuroimaging, developmental, and cognitive features, treatment responsiveness, and physical examination. In silico evaluation revealed 7 different highly conserved motifs, with the most common pathogenic mutation located in the first. Neuronal outgrowth assays showed that some TBC1D24 mutations, associated with the most severe TBC1D24-associated disorders, are not necessarily the most disruptive to this gene function. Conclusions: TBC1D24-related epilepsy syndromes show marked phenotypic pleiotropy, with multisystem involvement and severity spectrum ranging from isolated deafness (not studied here), benign myoclonic epilepsy restricted to childhood with complete seizure control and normal intellect, to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe developmental delay and early death. There is no distinct correlation with mutation type or location yet, but patterns are emerging. Given the phenotypic breadth observed, TBC1D24 mutation screening is indicated in a wide variety of epilepsies. A TBC1D24 consortium was formed to develop further research on this gene and its associated phenotypes.', 'Gut-Brain Glucose Signaling in Energy Homeostasis. Intestinal gluconeogenesis is a recently identified function influencing energy homeostasis. Intestinal gluconeogenesis induced by specific nutrients releases glucose, which is sensed by the nervous system surrounding the portal vein. This initiates a signal positively influencing parameters involved in glucose control and energy management controlled by the brain. This knowledge has extended our vision of the gut-brain axis, classically ascribed to gastrointestinal hormones. Our work raises several questions relating to the conditions under which intestinal gluconeogenesis proceeds and may provide its metabolic benefits. It also leads to questions on the advantage conferred by its conservation through a process of natural selection. Soty et al. discuss how intestinal gluconeogenesis induced by specific nutrients initiates neural sensing of glucose in the portal vein and a central signal positively influencing parameters involved in glucose control and energy management. This knowledge has extended our vision of the gut-brain axis, classically ascribed to gastrointestinal hormones.', 'Neurocomputational mechanisms at play when weighing concerns for extrinsic rewards, moral values, and social image. Humans not only value extrinsic monetary rewards but also their own morality and their image in the eyes of others. Yet violating moral norms is frequent, especially when people know that they are not under scrutiny. When moral values and monetary payoffs are at odds, how does the brain weigh the benefits and costs of moral and monetary payoffs? Here, using a neurocomputational model of decision value (DV) and functional (f)MRI, we investigated whether different brain systems are engaged when deciding whether to earn money by contributing to a “bad cause” and when deciding whether to sacrifice money to contribute to a “good cause,” both when such choices were made privately or in public. Although similar principles of DV computations were used to solve these dilemmas, they engaged 2 distinct valuation systems. When weighing monetary benefits and moral costs, people were willing to trade their moral values in exchange for money, an effect accompanied by DV computation engaging the anterior insula and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, weighing monetary costs against compliance with one’s moral values engaged the ventral putamen. Moreover, regardless of the type of dilemma, a brain network including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula, and the right temporoparietal junction (TJP) was more engaged in public than in private settings. Together, these findings identify how the brain processes three sources of motivation: extrinsic rewards, moral values, and concerns for image.', 'PET imaging of the influence of physiological and pathological α-synuclein on dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in mouse models. Aims: Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation is a neuropathological hallmark of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies. This in vivo study explored glucose metabolism and dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission in KO α-syn, wild-type mice and an accelerated murine model of synucleinopathy (M83). Methods: MicroPET acquisitions were performed in all animals aged 5-6\\xa0months using five radiotracers exploring brain glucose metabolism ([18F]FDG), dopamine neurotransmission ([11C]raclopride, [11C]PE2I) and serotonin neurotransmission ([18F]MPPF, [11C]DASB). For all radiotracers, except [18F]FDG, PET data were analyzed with a MRI-based VOI method and a voxel-based analysis. Results: MicroPET data showed a decrease in [11C]raclopride uptake in the caudate putamen of KO α-syn mice, in comparison with M83 and WT mice, reflecting a lower concentration of D2 receptors. The increase in [18F]MPPF uptake in M83 vs WT and KO mice indicates overexpression of 5-HT1A receptors. The lack of change in dopamine and serotonin transporters in all groups suggests unchanged neuronal density. Conclusions: This PET study highlights an effect of α-syn modulation on the expression of the D2 receptor, whereas aggregated α-syn leads to overexpression of 5-HT1A receptor, as a pathophysiological signature.', \"Spontaneous brain processing of the mammary pheromone in rabbit neonates prior to milk intake. Chemical signals play a critical role in interindividual communication, including mother-young relationships. Detecting odor cues released by the mammary area is vital to the newborn's survival. European rabbit females secret a mammary pheromone (MP) in their milk, which releases sucking-related orocephalic movements in newborns. Pups spontaneously display these typical movements at birth, independently of any perinatal learning. Our previous Fos mapping study (Charra et al., 2012) performed in 4-day-old rabbits showed that the MP activated a network of brain regions involved in osmoregulation, odor processing and arousal in comparison with a control odor. However, at this age, the predisposed appetitive value of the MP might be reinforced by previous milk intake. Here, the brain activation induced by the MP was examined by using Fos immunocytochemistry and compared to a neutral control odor in just born pups (day 0) that did not experienced milk intake. Compared to the control odor, the MP induced an increased Fos expression in the posterior piriform cortex. In the lateral hypothalamus, Fos immunostaining was combined with orexin detection since this peptide is involved in arousal/food-seeking behavior. The number of double-labeled cells was not different between MP and control odor stimulations but the total number of Fos stained cells was increased after MP exposure. Our results indicate that the MP does not activate the same regions in 0- vs. 4-day-old pups. This difference between the two ages may reflect a changing biological value of the MP in addition to its constant predisposed releasing value.\", 'Proving cortical death after vascular coma: Evoked potentials, EEG and neuroimaging. Objectives: Several studies have shown that bilateral abolition of somatosensory evoked potentials after a nontraumatic coma has 100% specificity for nonawakening with ethical consequences for active care withdrawal. We propose to evaluate the prognostic value of bilateral abolished cortical components of SEPs in severe vascular coma. Methods: A total of 144 comatose patients after subarachnoid haemorrhage were evaluated by multimodal evoked potentials (EPs); 7 patients presented a bilateral abolition of somatosensory and auditory EPs. Their prognosis value was interpreted with respect to brainstem auditory EPs, EEG, and structural imaging. Results: One patient emerged from vegetative state during follow-up; 6 patients did not return to consciousness. The main neurophysiological difference was a cortical reactivity to pain preserved in the patient who returned to consciousness. This patient had focal sub-cortical lesions, which could explain the abolition of primary cortical components by a bilateral deafferentation of somatosensory and auditory pathways. Conclusions: This is the first report of a favourable outcome after a multimodal abolition of primary cortex EPs in vascular coma. For the 3 cases of vascular coma with preserved brainstem function, EEG reactivity and cortical EPs were abolished by a diffuse ischaemia close to cerebral anoxia. Significance: The complementarity of EPs, EEG, and imaging must be emphasised if therapeutic limitations are considered to avoid over-interpretation of the prognosis value of EPs.', 'Hepatitis E virus infects neurons and brains. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), as a hepatotropic virus, is supposed to exclusively infect the liver and only cause hepatitis. However, a broad range of extrahepatic manifestations (in particular, idiopathic neurological disorders) have been recently reported in association with its infection. In this study, we have demonstrated that various human neural cell lines (embryonic stem cell–derived neural lineage cells) induced pluripotent stem cell–derived human neurons and primary mouse neurons are highly susceptible to HEV infection. Treatment with interferon-α or ribavirin, the off-label antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis E, exerted potent antiviral activities against HEV infection in neural cells. More importantly, in mice and monkey peripherally inoculated with HEV particles, viral RNA and protein were detected in brain tissues. Finally, patients with HEV-associated neurological disorders shed the virus into cerebrospinal fluid, indicating a direct infection of their nervous system. Thus, HEV is neurotropic in vitro, and in mice, monkeys, and possibly humans. These results challenge the dogma of HEV as a pure hepatotropic virus and suggest that HEV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic neurological disorders.', 'Molecular features of the measles virus viral fusion complex that favor infection and spread in the brain. Measles virus (MeV) bearing a single amino acid change in the fusion protein (F)—L454W—was isolated from two patients who died of MeV central nervous system (CNS) infection. This mutation in F confers an advantage over wild-type virus in the CNS, contributing to disease in these patients. Using murine ex vivo organotypic brain cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids, we show that CNS adaptive mutations in F enhance the spread of virus ex vivo. The spread of virus in human brain organoids is blocked by an inhibitory peptide that targets F, confirming that dissemination in the brain tissue is attribut-able to F. A single mutation in MeV F thus alters the fusion complex to render MeV more neuropathogenic. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) infection can cause serious complications in immu-nocompromised individuals, including measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE). In some cases, MeV persistence and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), another severe central nervous system (CNS) complication, develop even in the face of a systemic immune response. Both MIBE and SSPE are relatively rare but lethal. It is unclear how MeV causes CNS infection. We introduced specific mutations that are found in MIBE or SSPE cases into the MeV fusion protein to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of the viral fusion complex—comprising F and the receptor binding protein, H—allows virus to spread in the CNS. Using metagenomic, structural, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that altered fusion properties of the MeV H-F fusion complex permit MeV to spread in brain tissue.', 'Tau and cognitive disorders: A role for T lymphocytes. ', 'Impaired short-term memory for pitch in congenital amusia. Congenital amusia is a neuro-developmental disorder of music perception and production. The hypothesis is that the musical deficits arise from altered pitch processing, with impairments in pitch discrimination (i.e., pitch change detection, pitch direction discrimination and identification) and short-term memory. The present review article focuses on the deficit of short-term memory for pitch. Overall, the data discussed here suggest impairments at each level of processing in short-term memory tasks; starting with the encoding of the pitch information and the creation of the adequate memory trace, the retention of the pitch traces over time as well as the recollection and comparison of the stored information with newly incoming information. These impairments have been related to altered brain responses in a distributed fronto-temporal network, associated with decreased connectivity between these structures, as well as in abnormalities in the connectivity between the two auditory cortices. In contrast, amusic participants׳ short-term memory abilities for verbal material are preserved. These findings show that short-term memory deficits in congenital amusia are specific to pitch, suggesting a pitch-memory system that is, at least partly, separated from verbal memory. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Auditory working memory.', 'Diurnal transcriptome atlas of a primate across major neural and peripheral tissues. Diurnal gene expression patterns underlie time-of-the-day–specific functional specialization of tissues. However, available circadian gene expression atlases of a few organs are largely from nocturnal vertebrates. We report the diurnal transcriptome of 64 tissues, including 22 brain regions, sampled every 2 hours over 24 hours, from the primate Papio anubis (baboon). Genomic transcription was highly rhythmic, with up to 81.7% of protein-coding genes showing daily rhythms in expression. In addition to tissue-specific gene expression, the rhythmic transcriptome imparts another layer of functional specialization. Most ubiquitously expressed genes that participate in essential cellular functions exhibit rhythmic expression in a tissue-specific manner. The peak phases of rhythmic gene expression clustered around dawn and dusk, with a “quiescent period” during early night. Our findings also unveil a different temporal organization of central and peripheral tissues between diurnal and nocturnal animals.', 'Intravenous administration of scAAV9-Hexb normalizes lifespan and prevents pathology in sandhoff disease mice. Sandhoff disease (SD) is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase activity which is fatal because no effective treatment is available. A mouse model of Hexb deficiency reproduces the key pathognomonic features of SD patients with severe ubiquitous lysosomal dysfunction, GM2 accumulation, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, culminating in death at 4 months. Here, we show that a single intravenous neonatal administration of a self-complementary adeno-associated virus 9 vector (scAAV9) expressing the Hexb cDNA in SD mice is safe and sufficient to prevent disease development. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that this treatment results in a normal lifespan (over 700 days) and normalizes motor function assessed by a battery of behavioral tests, with scAAV9-treated SD mice being indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Biochemical analyses in multiple tissues showed a significant increase in hexosaminidase A activity, which reached 10?15% of normal levels. AAV9 treatment was sufficient to prevent GM2 and GA2 storage almost completely in the cerebrum (less so in the cerebellum), as well as thalamic reactive gliosis and thalamocortical neuron loss in treated Hexb -/- mice. In summary, this study demonstrated a widespread protective effect throughout the entire CNS after a single intravenous administration of the scAAV9-Hexb vector to neonatal SD mice.', 'Age-related modulations of alpha and gamma brain activities underlying anticipation and distraction. Attention operates through top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) mechanisms. Recently, it has been shown that slow (alpha) frequencies index facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms of TD attention and faster (gamma) frequencies signal BU attentional capture. Ageing is characterized by increased behavioral distractibility, resulting from either a reduced efficiency of TD attention or an enhanced triggering of BU attention. However, only few studies have investigated the impact of ageing upon the oscillatory activities involved in TD and BU attention. MEG data were collected from 14 elderly and 14 matched young healthy human participants while performing the Competitive Attention Task. Elderly participants displayed (1) exacerbated behavioral distractibility, (2) altered TD suppressive mechanisms, indexed by a reduced alpha synchronization in task-irrelevant regions, (3) less prominent alpha peak-frequency differences between cortical regions, (4) a similar BU system activation indexed by gamma activity, and (5) a reduced activation of lateral prefrontal inhibitory control regions. These results show that the ageing-related increased distractibility is of TD origin.', 'De Novo Truncating Variants in SON Cause Intellectual Disability, Congenital Malformations, and Failure to Thrive. SON is a key component of the spliceosomal complex and a critical mediator of constitutive and alternative splicing. Additionally, SON has been shown to influence cell-cycle progression, genomic integrity, and maintenance of pluripotency in stem cell populations. The clear functional relevance of SON in coordinating essential cellular processes and its presence in diverse human tissues suggests that intact SON might be crucial for normal growth and development. However, the phenotypic effects of deleterious germline variants in SON have not been clearly defined. Herein, we describe seven unrelated individuals with de novo variants in SON and propose that deleterious variants in SON are associated with a severe multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delay, persistent feeding difficulties, and congenital malformations, including brain anomalies.', 'Presenilin-mediated cleavage of APP regulates synaptotagmin-7 and presynaptic plasticity. Mutations of the intramembrane protease presenilin (PS) or of its main substrate, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cause early-onset form of Alzheimer disease. PS and APP interact with proteins of the neurotransmitter release machinery without identified functional consequences. Here we report that genetic deletion of PS markedly decreases the presynaptic levels of the Ca 2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) leading to impaired synaptic facilitation and replenishment of synaptic vesicles. The regulation of Syt7 expression by PS occurs post-transcriptionally and depends on γ-secretase proteolytic activity. It requires the substrate APP as revealed by the combined genetic invalidation of APP and PS1, and in particular the APP-Cterminal fragments which interact with Syt7 and accumulate in synaptic terminals under pharmacological or genetic inhibition of γ-secretase. Thus, we uncover a role of PS in presynaptic mechanisms, through APP cleavage and regulation of Syt7, that highlights aberrant synaptic vesicle processing as a possible new pathway in AD.', 'KIAA1109 Variants Are Associated with a Severe Disorder of Brain Development and Arthrogryposis. Whole-exome and targeted sequencing of 13 individuals from 10 unrelated families with overlapping clinical manifestations identified loss-of-function and missense variants in KIAA1109 allowing delineation of an autosomal-recessive multi-system syndrome, which we suggest to name Alkuraya-Kučinskas syndrome (MIM 617822). Shared phenotypic features representing the cardinal characteristics of this syndrome combine brain atrophy with clubfoot and arthrogryposis. Affected individuals present with cerebral parenchymal underdevelopment, ranging from major cerebral parenchymal thinning with lissencephalic aspect to moderate parenchymal rarefaction, severe to mild ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia with brainstem dysgenesis, and cardiac and ophthalmologic anomalies, such as microphthalmia and cataract. Severe loss-of-function cases were incompatible with life, whereas those individuals with milder missense variants presented with severe global developmental delay, syndactyly of 2nd and 3rd toes, and severe muscle hypotonia resulting in incapacity to stand without support. Consistent with a causative role for KIAA1109 loss-of-function/hypomorphic variants in this syndrome, knockdowns of the zebrafish orthologous gene resulted in embryos with hydrocephaly and abnormally curved notochords and overall body shape, whereas published knockouts of the fruit fly and mouse orthologous genes resulted in lethality or severe neurological defects reminiscent of the probands’ features.', 'Radio-frequency electromagnetic field exposure and contribution of sources in the general population: an organ-specific integrative exposure assessment. In order to achieve an integrated radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) dose assessment, detailed information about source-specific exposure duration and output power is needed. We developed an Integrated Exposure Model (IEM) to combine energy absorbed due to use of and exposure to RF-EMF sources and applied it to a sample of the general population to derive population RF-EMF estimates. The IEM used specific absorption rate transfer algorithms to provide RF-EMF daily dose estimates (mJ/kg/day) using source-specific attributes (e.g. output power, distance), personal characteristics and usage patterns. Information was obtained from an international survey performed in four European countries with 1755 participants. We obtained median whole-body and whole-brain doses of 183.7 and 204.4 mJ/kg/day. Main contributors to whole-brain dose were mobile phone near the head for calling (2G networks) and far-field sources, whereas the latter together with multiple other RF-EMF sources were main contributors for whole-body dose. For other anatomical sites, 2G phone calls, mobile data and far-field exposure were important contributors. The IEM provides insight into main contributors to total RF-EMF dose and, applied to an international survey, provides an estimate of population RF-dose. The IEM can be used in future epidemiological studies, risk assessments and exposure reduction strategies.', 'IQSEC2-related encephalopathy in males and females: a comparative study including 37 novel patients. Purpose: Variants in IQSEC2, escaping X inactivation, cause X-linked intellectual disability with frequent epilepsy in males and females. We aimed to investigate sex-specific differences. Methods: We collected the data of 37 unpublished patients (18 males and 19 females) with IQSEC2 pathogenic variants and 5 individuals with variants of unknown significance and reviewed published variants. We compared variant types and phenotypes in males and females and performed an analysis of IQSEC2 isoforms. Results: IQSEC2 pathogenic variants mainly led to premature truncation and were scattered throughout the longest brain-specific isoform, encoding the synaptic IQSEC2/BRAG1 protein. Variants occurred de novo in females but were either de novo (2/3) or inherited (1/3) in males, with missense variants being predominantly inherited. Developmental delay and intellectual disability were overall more severe in males than in females. Likewise, seizures were more frequently observed and intractable, and started earlier in males than in females. No correlation was observed between the age at seizure onset and severity of intellectual disability or resistance to antiepileptic treatments. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview of IQSEC2-related encephalopathy in males and females, and suggests that an accurate dosage of IQSEC2 at the synapse is crucial during normal brain development.', 'An Integrative Interdisciplinary Perspective on Social Dominance Hierarchies. In the course of evolution, social dominance has been a strong force shaping the organization of social systems in many species. Individuals with a better ability to represent social dominance relationships and to adapt their behavior accordingly usually achieve better access to resources, hence providing benefits in terms of reproduction, health, and wellbeing. Understanding how and to what extent our brains are affected by social dominance requires interdisciplinary efforts. Here, we integrate findings from social neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and developmental psychology to highlight how social hierarchies are learned and represented in primates. We also review neuropharmacological findings showing how dopamine, serotonin, and testosterone influence social hierarchies and we emphasize their key clinical implications on vulnerabilities to neuropsychiatric disorders. The drive to occupy a specific social dominance status is deeply rooted in the biology and evolutionary history of our species. Dominance hierarchies emerge early in development, and children use a variety of cues to learn about social dominance relationships. Learning social hierarchy information engages the anterior mPFC, both when learning ranks by observation and when learning by direct dyadic competitive interactions. The neurocomputational mechanisms at play when learning social hierarchies have been identified using model-based fMRI. Dopamine, serotonin, and testosterone are central to the emergence of social hierarchies across species. Understanding the neural bases of social dominance hierarchies is key to explain interindividual differences in human cognition and has important clinical implications.', 'Biomechanical characterization of ex vivo human brain using ultrasound shear wave spectroscopy. The characterization of brain tissue is crucial to better understand neurological disorders. Mechanical characterization is an emerging tool in that field. The purpose of this work was to validate a transient ultrasound technique aimed at measuring dispersion of mechanical parameters of the brain tissue. The first part of this work was dedicated to the validation of that technique by comparing it with two proven rheology methods: a rotating plate rheometer, and a viscoelastic spectroscopy apparatus. Experiments were done on tissue mimicking gels. Results were compared on storage and loss modulus in the 20–100 Hz band. Our method was validated for the measurement of storage modulus dispersion, with some reserves on the measurement of loss modulus. The second part of this work was the measurement of the mechanical characteristics of ex vivo human white matter. We were able to measure the dispersion of the storage and loss modulus in the 20–100 Hz band, fitting the data with a custom power law model.', 'The neuroscience of meditation: classification, phenomenology, correlates, and mechanisms. Rising from its contemplative and spiritual traditions, the science of meditation has seen huge growth over the last 30 years. This chapter reviews the classifications, phenomenology, neural correlates, and mechanisms of meditation. Meditation classification types are still varied and largely subjective. Broader models to describe meditation practice along multidimensional parameters may improve classification in the future. Phenomenological studies are few but growing, highlighting the subjective experience and correlations to neurophysiology. Oscillatory EEG studies are not conclusive likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the meditation styles and practitioners being assessed. Neuroimaging studies find common patterns during meditation and in long-term meditators reflecting the basic similarities of meditation in general; however, mostly the patterns differ across unique meditation traditions. Research on the mechanisms of meditation, specifically attention and emotion regulation is also discussed. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating positive benefits from meditation in some clinical populations especially for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, and pain improvement, although future research would benefit by addressing the remaining methodological and conceptual issues. Meditation research continues to grow allowing us to understand greater nuances of how meditation works and its effects.', 'Selective modulation of interhemispheric connectivity by transcranial alternating current stimulation influences binaural integration. Brain connectivity plays a major role in the encoding, transfer, and integration of sensory information. Interregional synchronization of neural oscillations in the γ-frequency band has been suggested as a key mechanism underlying perceptual integration. In a recent study, we found evidence for this hypothesis showing that the modulation of interhemispheric oscillatory synchrony by means of bihemispheric high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-TACS) affects binaural integration of dichotic acoustic features. Here, we aimed to establish a direct link between oscillatory synchrony, effective brain connectivity, and binaural integration. We experimentally manipulated oscillatory synchrony (using bihemispheric γ-TACS with different interhemispheric phase lags) and assessed the effect on effective brain connectivity and binaural integration (as measured with functional MRI and a dichotic listening task, respectively). We found that TACS reduced intrahemispheric connectivity within the auditory cortices and antiphase (interhemispheric phase lag 180°) TACS modulated connectivity between the two auditory cortices. Importantly, the changes in intra- and interhemispheric connectivity induced by TACS were correlated with changes in perceptual integration. Our results indicate that γ-band synchronization between the two auditory cortices plays a functional role in binaural integration, supporting the proposed role of interregional oscillatory synchrony in perceptual integration.', 'Proteoglycan 4 Reduces Neuroinflammation and Protects the Blood-Brain Barrier after Traumatic Brain Injury. Neuroinflammation and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are two prominent mechanisms of secondary injury in neurotrauma. It has been suggested that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in initiating and propagating neuroinflammation resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI), but potential beneficial effects of targeting these receptors in TBI have not been broadly studied. Here, we investigated the effect of targeting TLRs with proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) on post-traumatic neuroinflammation and BBB function. PRG4 is a mucinous glycoprotein with strong anti-inflammatory properties, exerting its biological effects by interfering with TLR2/4 signaling. In addition, PRG4 has the ability to inhibit activation of cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), a cell-surface glycoprotein playing an important role in inflammation. Using the controlled cortical impact model of TBI in rats, we showed a rapid and prolonged upregulation of message for TLR2/4 and CD44 in the injured cortex. In the in vitro model of the BBB, recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) crossed the endothelial monolayers through a high-capacity, saturable transport system. In rats sustaining TBI, PRG4 delivery to the brain was enhanced by post-traumatic increase in BBB permeability. rhPRG4 injected intravenously at 1 h post-TBI potently inhibited post-traumatic activation of nuclear factor kappa B and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, the two major signal transduction pathways associated with TLR2/4 and CD44, and curtailed the post-traumatic influx of monocytes. In addition, PRG4 restored normal BBB function after TBI by preventing the post-traumatic loss of tight junction protein claudin 5 and reduced neuronal death. Our observations provide support for therapeutic strategies targeting TLRs in TBI.', 'Early cognitive, structural, and microstructural changes in presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers younger than 40 years. IMPORTANCE Presymptomatic carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutation, the most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, represent the optimal target population for the development of disease-modifying drugs. Preclinical biomarkers are needed to monitor the effect of therapeutic interventions in this population. OBJECTIVES To assess the occurrence of cognitive, structural, and microstructural changes in presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PREV-DEMALS study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. Eighty-four participants entered the study between October 2015 and April 2017; 80 (95%) were included in cross-sectional analyses of baseline data. All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging; 63 (79%) underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Gray matter volumes and diffusion tensor imaging metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Anatomical and microstructural differences between individuals who carried the C9orf72 mutation (C9+) and those who did not carry the C9orf72 mutation (C9−) were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Data were analyzed from October 2015 to April 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in neuropsychological scores, gray matter volume, and white matter integrity between C9+ and C9− individuals. RESULTS Of the 80 included participants, there were 41 C9+ individuals (24 [59%] female; mean [SD] age, 39.8 [11.1] years) and 39 C9− individuals (24 [62%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.2 [13.9] years). Compared with C9− individuals, C9+ individuals had lower mean (SD) praxis scores (163.4 [6.1] vs 165.3 [5.9]; P = .01) and intransitive gesture scores (34.9 [1.6] vs 35.7 [1.5]; P = .004), atrophy in 8 cortical regions of interest and in the right thalamus, and white matter alterations in 8 tracts. When restricting the analyses to participants younger than 40 years, compared with C9− individuals, C9+ individuals had lower praxis scores and intransitive gesture scores, atrophy in 4 cortical regions of interest and in the right thalamus, and white matter alterations in 2 tracts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cognitive, structural, and microstructural alterations are detectable in young C9+ individuals. Early and subtle praxis alterations, underpinned by focal atrophy of the left supramarginal gyrus, may represent an early and nonevolving phenotype related to neurodevelopmental effects of C9orf72 mutation. White matter alterations reflect the future phenotype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while atrophy appears more diffuse. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the preclinical phase of C9orf72 disease and of the respective contribution of magnetic resonance biomarkers.', 'Awake brain surgery in children—a single-center experience. Introduction: Awake brain surgery (ABS) represents a rare surgical procedure in children as age and psychological aspects, which are considered to interfere with its feasibility and psychological outcome and limit its application. Only few pediatric case series have been reported so far, indicating a more complex translation of this surgical approach to children. However, the advances in neuropsychological testing and monitoring may have a substantial impact on ameliorating the eligibility of children undergoing awake procedures. This study addresses the condition of ABS in a pediatric cohort, focusing on its practicability and diversified outcome aspects. Methods: We performed a retrospective review and prospective outcome analysis of pediatric patients with CNS lesions undergoing ABS between 2005 and 2018, completed at the University of Lyon, France. Results: Eighteen children were considered for ABS with respect to the eloquent location of their CNS lesions documented in their pre-operative MRI. Seventeen of them underwent asleep–awake–asleep brain surgery. The cohort included 5 males and 12 females. The median age at surgery was 14.8\\xa0years, (range 9.4 to 17.6\\xa0years). Intraoperative testing included electrocortical stimulation while pursuing speech or motor activity. Most of the lesions were intrinsic tumors of glial origin. A complete tumor removal was achieved in 11 patients (65%). Post-operative neurological deficits were transiently observed in 2 patients, whereas severe psychological reactions occurred in 1 child. Persistent attention deficits were found in 2 patients. One patient experienced an infectious complication requiring antibiotic treatment. Two patients died during follow-up due to tumor progression. The mean duration of follow up was 22.2\\xa0months (range 3.4 to 46.8\\xa0months). Conclusions: ABS was shown to be beneficial in terms of efficient tumor resection besides simultaneous preservation of neurological functions. Psychological preparation of the families and the children is essential to increase the number and age range of patients, who can benefit from this technique. Neuropsychological testing before and after surgery is essential to determine cognitive outcome, which can be altered in a minority of patients.', 'Evidence for dopaminergic denervation in classical galactosemia. ', 'Imaging spectrum of Bing–Neel syndrome: how can a radiologist recognise this rare neurological complication of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia?. Objectives: Bing–Neel syndrome (BNS) is a rare neurological complication of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. The aim of this study is to describe the spectrum of radiological manifestations of this syndrome and their prevalence in order to facilitate its early diagnosis. Methods: Twenty-four patients with BNS were diagnosed between 1994 and 2016 in eight centres in France. We retrospectively examined the medical records of these patients as well as the corresponding literature, focusing on imaging studies. Recorded data were statistically analysed and radiological findings described. Results: The mean age of our patients was 62.4 years (35–80 years). The vast majority of patients were men, with a male to female ratio of 9:1. Findings included parenchymal or meningeal involvement or both. The most common finding was leptomeningeal infiltration, either intracranial or spinal, with a prevalence reaching 70.8%. Dural involvement was present in 37.5% of patients. In 41.7% (10/24) of patients, there was parenchymal involvement with a higher prevalence of brain comparing to medullar involvement (33.3% and 23.1% respectively). High T2 signal of the parenchyma was identified in 41.7% of patients and high signal in diffusion was evident in 25% of them. Intraorbital or periorbital involvement was also detected in four cases. A proposition regarding the appropriate imaging protocol completed our study. Conclusion: BNS’s diagnosis remains challenging. Central nervous system MRI findings in the setting of known or suspected Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia appear to be highly suggestive of BNS and appropriate imaging protocols should be implemented for their depiction. Key Points: • Diagnosis of Bing–Neel syndrome (BNS) remains challenging and recent expert recommendations include MRI in the diagnostic criteria for the syndrome. • The most common radiological manifestations of BNS are leptomeningeal/dural infiltration or parenchymal involvement of brain or spinal cord, but many atypical forms may exist with various presentations. • Appropriate imaging protocol for BNS should include enhanced MRI studies of both brain and spine.', 'Protection of brain development by antenatal magnesium sulphate for infants born preterm. Cerebral palsy (CP) remains the most significant neurological disorder associated with preterm birth. It disrupts quality of life and places huge cost burdens on society. Antenatal magnesium sulphate administration to females before 32 weeks’ gestation has proven to be an effective intervention to reduce the rate of CP. In models of hypoxia, hypoxia-ischemia, inflammation, and excitotoxicity in various animal species, magnesium sulphate preconditioning decreased the resulting lesion sizes and inflammatory cytokine levels, prevented cell death, and improved long-term cognitive and motor behaviours. In humans, meta-analyses of five randomized controlled trials using magnesium sulphate as a neuroprotectant showed prevention of CP at 2 years. The benefit remained consistent regardless of gestational age, cause of preterm birth, and total dose received. Antenatal magnesium sulphate treatment is now recommended by the World Health Organization and by many obstetric societies. Its cost-effectiveness further justifies its widespread implementation. What this paper adds: Neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulphate to reduce cerebral palsy in infants born preterm when administered to females at risk of imminent preterm birth. Neuroprotection regardless of gestational age, cause of preterm birth, and total dose. Antenatal magnesium sulphate treatment has good cost-effectiveness.', 'Syntactic processing in music and language: Effects of interrupting auditory streams with alternating timbres. Music and language both rely on the processing of spectral (pitch, timbre) and temporal (rhythm) information to create structure and meaning from incoming auditory streams. Behavioral results have shown that interrupting a melodic stream with unexpected changes in timbre leads to reduced syntactic processing. Such findings suggest that syntactic processing is conditional on successful streaming of incoming sequential information. The current study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether (1) the effect of alternating timbres on syntactic processing is reflected in a reduced brain response to syntactic violations, and (2) the phenomenon is similar for music and language. Participants listened to melodies and sentences with either one timbre (piano or one voice) or three timbres (piano, guitar, and vibraphone, or three different voices). Half the stimuli contained syntactic violations: an out-of-key note in the melodies, and a phrase-structure violation in the sentences. We found smaller ERPs to syntactic violations in music in the three-timbre compared to the one-timbre condition, reflected in a reduced early right anterior negativity (ERAN). A similar but non-significant pattern was observed for language stimuli in both the early left anterior negativity (ELAN) and the left anterior negativity (LAN) ERPs. The results suggest that disruptions to auditory streaming may interfere with syntactic processing, especially for melodic sequences.', 'Integrating when and what information in the left parietal lobule allows language rule generalization. A crucial aspect when learning a language is discovering the rules that govern how words are combined in order to convey meanings. Because rules are characterized by sequential co-occurrences between elements (e.g., “These cupcakes are unbelievable”), tracking the statistical relationships between these elements is fundamental. However, purely bottom-up statistical learning alone cannot fully account for the ability to create abstract rule representations that can be generalized, a paramount requirement of linguistic rules. Here, we provide evidence that, after the statistical relations between words have been extracted, the engagement of goal-directed attention is key to enable rule generalization. Incidental learning performance during a rule-learning task on an artificial language revealed a progressive shift from statistical learning to goal-directed attention. In addition, and consistent with the recruitment of attention, functional MRI (fMRI) analyses of late learning stages showed left parietal activity within a broad bilateral dorsal frontoparietal network. Critically, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on participants’ peak of activation within the left parietal cortex impaired their ability to generalize learned rules to a structurally analogous new language. No stimulation or rTMS on a nonrelevant brain region did not have the same interfering effect on generalization. Performance on an additional attentional task showed that this rTMS on the parietal site hindered participants’ ability to integrate “what” (stimulus identity) and “when” (stimulus timing) information about an expected target. The present findings suggest that learning rules from speech is a two-stage process: following statistical learning, goal-directed attention—involving left parietal regions—integrates “what” and “when” stimulus information to facilitate rapid rule generalization.', 'Subjective craving and event-related brain response to olfactory and visual chocolate cues in binge-eating and healthy individuals. High-sugar/high-fat foods are related to binge-eating behaviour and especially people with low inhibitory control may encounter elevated difficulties to resist their intake. Incentive sensitization to food-related cues might lead to increased motivated attention towards these stimuli and to cue-induced craving. To investigate the combined influence of olfactory and visual stimuli on craving, inhibitory control and motivated attention, 20 healthy controls and 19 individuals with binge-eating viewed chocolate and neutral pictures, primed by chocolate or neutral odours. Subjective craving and electroencephalogram activity were recorded during the task. N2 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes were analysed. Patients reported higher craving than controls. Subjective craving, N2 and LPP amplitudes were higher for chocolate versus neutral pictures. Patients showed a higher relative increase in N2 amplitudes to chocolate versus neutral pictures than controls. Chocolate images induced significant increases in craving, motivated attention and measures of cognitive control. Chocolate odour might potentiate the craving response to visual stimuli, especially in patients with binge-eating.', 'The wide POLG-related spectrum: An integrated view. The aims of this study were to describe the spectrum of recessively inherited POLG-related disorders, to report new POLG mutations and to discuss genotype-phenotype correlations in order to propose a strategy for diagnosis. Twenty eight patients diagnosed with two POLG mutations at 12 tertiary European centers of adult neurology were studied. Exhaustive phenotypic data, brain MRI, muscle analysis, mitochondrial DNA and POLG analysis findings were collected. Five distinct phenotypes were observed: Sensory Ataxic Neuropathy, Dysarthria and Ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), Spino Cerebellar Ataxia with Epilepsy (SCAE), Mitochondrial Neuro Gastro Intestinal Encephalopathy (MNGIE)-like phenotype and Sensory Ataxic Neuropathy with Ophthalmoparesis but without dysarthria which we propose to name SANO. An increasing gradient of functional severity was appreciated from PEO with the best prognosis, to SANO, SANDO and finally SCAE respectively. Four new missense mutations were found. Regarding genotype/phenotype correlations, P587L mutation was associated with SANO rather than with SANDO (p<0.005) and W748S mutation was associated with SANDO or SCAE (with more severe disease progression), rather than with SANO or PEO (p<0.004). Distinguishing between various phenotypes can have important diagnosis and prognosis implications. POLG mutations should be priority searched for in cases of SANDO or SANO. Mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial DNA studies should be considered in the case of negative POLG analysis or other phenotypes.', 'A neuropathological study of novel RTTN gene mutations causing a familial microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern. Background: The RTTN gene encodes Rotatin, a large centrosomal protein involved in ciliary functions. RTTN mutations have been reported in seven families and are associated with two phenotypes: polymicrogyria associated with seizures and primary microcephaly associated with primordial dwarfism. Case: A targeted exome sequencing of morbid genes causing cerebral malformations identified novel RTTN compound heterozygous mutations in a family where three pregnancies were terminated because a severe fetal microcephaly was diagnosed. An autopsy performed on the second sib showed moderate growth restriction and a microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern. The histopathological study discovered a malformed cortical plate. Conclusions: The present study confirms the involvement of RTTN gene mutations in microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern and describes the observed abnormal neuropathological findings.', 'Normal EEG during the neonatal period: maturational aspects from premature to full-term newborns. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the reference tool for the analysis of brain function, reflecting normal and pathological neuronal network activity. During the neonatal period, EEG patterns evolve weekly, according to gestational age. The first analytical criteria for the various maturational stages and standardized neonatal EEG terminology were published by a group of French neurophysiologists training in Paris (France) in 1999. These criteria, defined from analog EEG, were completed in 2010 with digital EEG analysis. Since then, this work has continued, aided by the technical progress in EEG acquisition, the improvement of knowledge on the maturating processes of neuronal networks, and the evolution of critical care. In this review, we present an exhaustive and didactic overview of EEG characteristics from extremely premature to full-term infants. This update is based on the scientific literature, enhanced by the study of normal EEGs of extremely premature infants by our group of neurophysiologists. For educational purposes, particular attention has been paid to illustrations using new digital tools.', 'In utero Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure confers vulnerability towards cognitive impairments and alcohol drinking in the adolescent offspring: Is there a role for neuropeptide Y?. Background: Cannabinoid consumption during pregnancy has been increasing on the wave of the broad-based legalisation of cannabis in Western countries, raising concern about the putative detrimental outcomes on foetal neurodevelopment. Indeed, since the endocannabinoid system regulates synaptic plasticity, emotional and cognitive processes from early stages of life interfering with it and other excitability endogenous modulators, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), might contribute to the occurrence of a vulnerable phenotype later in life. Aims: This research investigated whether in utero exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may induce deficits in emotional/cognitive processes and alcohol vulnerability in adolescent offspring. NPY and excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) machinery were measured as markers of neurobiological vulnerability. Methods: Following in utero THC exposure (2 mg/kg delivered subcutaneously), preadolescent male rat offspring were assessed for: behavioural reactivity in the open field test, neutral declarative memory and aversive limbic memory in the Novel Object and Emotional Object Recognition tests, immunofluorescence for NPY neurons and the PSD proteins Homer-1, 1b/c and 2 in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens at adolescence (cohort 1); and instrumental learning, alcohol taking, relapse and conflict behaviour in the operant chamber throughout adolescence until early adulthood (cohort 2). Results: In utero THC-exposed adolescent rats showed: (a) increased locomotor activity; (b) no alteration in neutral declarative memory; (c) impaired aversive limbic memory; (d) decreased NPY-positive neurons in limbic regions; (e) region-specific variations in Homer-1, 1b/c and 2 immunoreactivity; (f) decreased instrumental learning and increased alcohol drinking, relapse and conflict behaviour in the operant chamber. Conclusion: Gestational THC impaired the formation of memory traces when integration between environmental encoding and emotional/motivational processing was required and promoted the development of alcohol-addictive behaviours. The abnormalities in NPY signalling and PSD make-up may represent the common neurobiological background, suggesting new targets for future research.', 'Culture: The Driving Force of Human Cognition. It is often, though sometimes only implicitly, assumed that biological/genetic evolution sets neural substrates, that neural substrates fix cognitive abilities, and that cognitive abilities determine the spectrum of cultural practices exhibited by a biological species. We label this view as the “bottom-up-only” view. In this paper we will show that such a “chain of dependence” is much looser than usually assumed, especially as far as recent periods (the last 800,000\\xa0years vs. the last 7 million years or more) are considered. We will provide evidence and arguments supporting the idea that cultural innovation may have direct and ascertainable effects both on the cognitive capabilities of populations of hominins (via what we call “cultural exaptation”) and on the neural substrates of the individuals in those populations (via what we call “cultural neural reuse”). Together, cultural exaptation and cultural neural reuse may give raise to a plausible general mechanism for cognitive evolution in which culture is the driving force, thus offering a “top-down-also” view of human evolution.', 'FIP1L1-PDGFRA-Associated Hypereosinophilic Syndrome as a Treatable Cause of Watershed Infarction. Background and Purpose: Ischemic stroke has been reported in various conditions associated with eosinophilia. FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion ([Fip1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha]; F/P) leads to the proliferation of the eosinophilic lineage and thus to a clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome that is highly responsive to imatinib. Methods: We previously reported on a nationwide retrospective study of 151 patients with F/P-associated clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients from this cohort with a clinical history of ischemic stroke (as well as 2 additional cases) were further analyzed to better define their clinical picture and outcomes. Results: Sixteen male patients (median age, 51 [43-59] years) with low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk were included. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 4 (range, 1-6). Most cerebral imaging disclosed multiple bilateral infarctions of watershed distribution (69%). Despite frequent cardiac involvement (50%), cardiac thrombus was evidenced in a single patient and, according to the TOAST classification (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment), 62.5% of strokes were presumably of undetermined etiology. Among the 15 patients treated with imatinib, and after a median follow-up of 4.5 years, stroke recurred in only 3 patients (consisting of either cardio embolic or hemorrhagic events, unrelated to the first episode). Conclusions: F/P+ clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome is a diagnosis to consider in patients with unexplained ischemic stroke and hypereosinophilia (especially in the setting of multiple cortical borderzone distribution) and warrants prompt initiation of imatinib.', 'How to apply the movement disorder society criteria for diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy. Background: The Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy define diagnostic allocations, stratified by certainty levels and clinical predominance types. We aimed to study the frequency of ambiguous multiple allocations and to develop rules to eliminate them. Methods: We retrospectively collected standardized clinical data by chart review in a multicenter cohort of autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, to classify them by diagnostic certainty level and predominance type and to identify multiple allocations. Results: Comprehensive data were available from 195 patients. More than one diagnostic allocation occurred in 157 patients (80.5%). On average, 5.4 allocations were possible per patient. We developed four rules for Multiple Allocations eXtinction (MAX). They reduced the number of patients with multiple allocations to 22 (11.3%), and the allocations per patient to 1.1. Conclusions: The proposed MAX rules help to standardize the application of the Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.', 'Sustained neural rhythms reveal endogenous oscillations supporting speech perception. Rhythmic sensory or electrical stimulation will produce rhythmic brain responses. These rhythmic responses are often interpreted as endogenous neural oscillations aligned (or “entrained”) to the stimulus rhythm. However, stimulus-aligned brain responses can also be explained as a sequence of evoked responses, which only appear regular due to the rhythmicity of the stimulus, without necessarily involving underlying neural oscillations. To distinguish evoked responses from true oscillatory activity, we tested whether rhythmic stimulation produces oscillatory responses which continue after the end of the stimulus. Such sustained effects provide evidence for true involvement of neural oscillations. In Experiment 1, we found that rhythmic intelligible, but not unintelligible speech produces oscillatory responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG) which outlast the stimulus at parietal sensors. In Experiment 2, we found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) leads to rhythmic fluctuations in speech perception outcomes after the end of electrical stimulation. We further report that the phase relation between electroencephalography (EEG) responses and rhythmic intelligible speech can predict the tACS phase that leads to most accurate speech perception. Together, we provide fundamental results for several lines of research—including neural entrainment and tACS—and reveal endogenous neural oscillations as a key underlying principle for speech perception.', 'The multiscale entropy: Guidelines for use and interpretation in brain signal analysis. Background Multiscale entropy (MSE) estimates the predictability of a signal over multiple temporal scales. It has been recently applied to study brain signal variability, notably during aging. The grounds of its application and interpretation remain unclear and subject to debate. Method We used both simulated and experimental data to provide an intuitive explanation of MSE and to explore how it relates to the frequency content of the signal, depending on the amount of (non)linearity and stochasticity in the underlying dynamics. Results The scaling and peak-structure of MSE curves relate to the scaling and peaks of the power spectrum in the presence of linear autocorrelations. MSE also captures nonlinear autocorrelations and their interactions with stochastic dynamical components. The previously reported crossing of young and old adults’ MSE curves for EEG data appears to be mainly due to linear stochastic processes, and relates to young adults’ EEG dynamics exhibiting a slower time constant. Comparison with existing methods We make the relationship between MSE curve and power spectrum as well as with a linear autocorrelation measure, namely multiscale root-mean-square-successive-difference, more explicit. MSE allows gaining insight into the time-structure of brain activity fluctuations. Its combined use with other metrics could prevent any misleading interpretations with regard to underlying stochastic processes. Conclusions Although not straightforward, when applied to brain signals, the features of MSE curves can be linked to their power content and provide information about both linear and nonlinear autocorrelations that are present therein.', \"Glucocerebrosidase deficiency in dopaminergic neurons induces microglial activation without neurodegeneration. Mutations in the GBA1 gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) are important risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). In vitro, altered GBA1 activity promotes alpha-synuclein accumulation whereas elevated levels of alpha-synuclein compromise GBA1 function, thus supporting a pathogenic mechanism in PD. However, the mechanisms by which GBA1 deficiency is linked to increased risk of PD remain elusive, partially because of lack of aged models of GBA1 deficiency. As knocking-out GBA1 in the entire brain induces massive neurodegeneration and early death, we generated a mouse model of GBA1 deficiency amenable to investigate the long-term consequences of compromised GBA1 function in dopaminergic neurons. DAT-Cre and GBA1-floxed mice were bred to obtain selective homozygous disruption of GBA1 in midbrain dopamine neurons (DAT-GBA1-KO). Mice were followed for motor function, neuronal survival, alpha-synuclein phosphorylation and glial activation. Susceptibility to nigral viral vector-mediated overexpression of mutated (A53T) alpha-synuclein was assessed. Despite loss of GBA1 and substrate accumulation, DAT-GBA1-KO mice displayed normal motor performances and preserved dopaminergic neurons despite robust microglial activation in the substantia nigra, without accumulation of endogenous alpha-synuclein with respect to wild-type mice. Lysosomal function was only marginally affected. Screening of micro- RNAs linked to the regulation of GBA1, alpha-synuclein or neuroinflammation did not reveal significant alterations. Viral-mediated overexpression of A53T-alpha-synuclein yielded similar neurodegeneration in DAT-GBA1-KO mice and wild-type mice. These results indicate that loss of GBA1 function in mouse dopaminergic neurons is not critical for alphasynuclein accumulation or neurodegeneration and suggest the involvement of GBA1 deficiency in other cell types as a potential mechanism.\", 'Semiology of insular lobe seizures. After the early attempts of intra-operative electrocorticography and insulectomy in the 1950s, the notion of insular lobe seizures was largely forgotten for decades. It is only since the late 1990s that the recent technique of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) enabled preoperative diagnosis of insular origin seizures and thus gave rise to a renewed interest for this ill-defined electroclinical entity. Owing to the multiple functional roles of insula and its extensive connectivity with adjacent as well as distant brain structures, insular lobe seizures present with a combination or series of diverse subjective and objective symptoms. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the semiology of insular origin seizures. The following two distinct forms of clinical presentation have been recognized: 1) Seizures with predominant insulo-perisylvian symptoms, most notably paraesthesia and cervico-laryngeal discomfort. The former typically involves a large/bilateral cutaneous territory and can be perceived as cold, hot, or painful sensations. The latter ranges from slight dyspnea to strong sensation of strangulation. Other symptoms include epigastric discomfort/nausea, hypersalivation, auditory, vestibular, gustatory, and aphasic symptoms. 2) Nocturnal hyperkinetic seizures with/without tonic elevation of upper limbs, masquerading as fronto-mesial seizures. Patients are usually not fully aware of their symptoms despite preserved contact and organized behavior to others. Ipsilateral eye blinking can be observed. These two patterns often occur in succession or simultaneously. This characteristic combination and progression of ictal symptoms orients us strongly towards an insular origin of seizure, a better understanding of which is a crucial key to further optimize modern SEEG strategy.', 'Dietary n-3 long chain PUFA supplementation promotes a pro-resolving oxylipin profile in the brain. The brain is highly enriched in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) that display immunomodulatory properties in the brain. At the periphery, the modulation of inflammation by LC-PUFAs occurs through lipid mediators called oxylipins which have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities when derived from n-3 LC-PUFAs and pro-inflammatory activities when derived from n-6 LC-PUFAs. However, whether a diet rich in LC-PUFAs modulates oxylipins and neuroinflammation in the brain has been poorly investigated. In this study, the effect of a dietary n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation on oxylipin profile and neuroinflammation in the brain was analyzed. Mice were given diets deficient or supplemented in n-3 LC-PUFAs for a 2-month period starting at post-natal day 21, followed by a peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at adulthood. We first showed that dietary n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation induced n-3 LC-PUFA enrichment in the hippocampus and subsequently an increase in n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and a decrease in n-6 PUFA-derived oxylipins. In response to LPS, n-3 LC-PUFA deficient mice presented a pro-inflammatory oxylipin profile whereas n-3 LC-PUFA supplemented mice displayed an anti-inflammatory oxylipin profile in the hippocampus. Accordingly, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, the enzymes implicated in pro- and anti-inflammatory oxylipin synthesis, was induced by LPS in both diets. In addition, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine increase was reduced by dietary n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation. These results indicate that brain n-3 LC-PUFAs increase by dietary means and promote the synthesis of anti-inflammatory derived bioactive oxylipins. As neuroinflammation plays a key role in all brain injuries and many neurodegenerative disorders, the present data suggest that dietary habits may be an important regulator of brain cytokine production in these contexts.', 'Dysfunctional autism risk genes cause circuit-specific connectivity deficits with distinct developmental trajectories. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of complex neurodevelopmental disorders for which there is currently no targeted therapeutic approach. It is thought that alterations of genes regulating migration and synapse formation during development affect neural circuit formation and result in aberrant connectivity within distinct circuits that underlie abnormal behaviors. However, it is unknown whether deviant developmental trajectories are circuit-specific for a given autism risk-gene. We used MRI to probe changes in functional and structural connectivity from childhood to adulthood in Fragile-X (Fmr1−/y) and contactin-associated (CNTNAP2−/−) knockout mice. Young Fmr1−/y mice (30 days postnatal) presented with a robust hypoconnectivity phenotype in corticocortico and corticostriatal circuits in areas associated with sensory information processing, which was maintained until adulthood. Conversely, only small differences in hippocampal and striatal areas were present during early postnatal development in CNTNAP2−/− mice, while major connectivity deficits in prefrontal and limbic pathways developed between adolescence and adulthood. These findings are supported by viral tracing and electron micrograph approaches and define 2 clearly distinct connectivity endophenotypes within the autism spectrum. We conclude that the genetic background of ASD strongly influences which circuits are most affected, the nature of the phenotype, and the developmental time course of the associated changes.', 'A Fast Visual Recognition Memory System in Humans Identified Using Intracerebral ERP. One key item of information retrieved when surveying our visual world is whether or not objects are familiar. However, there is no consensus on the respective roles of medial temporal lobe structures, particularly the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and hippocampus. We considered whether the PRC could support a fast recognition memory system independently from the hippocampus. We recorded the intracerebral electroencephalograph activity of epileptic patients while they were performing a fast visual recognition memory task, constraining them to use their quickest strategy. We performed event-related potential (ERP) and classification analyses. The PRC was, by far, the earliest region involved in recognition memory. This activity occurred before the first behavioral responses and was found to be related to reaction times, unlike the hippocampus. Single-trial analyses showed that decoding power was equivalent in the PRC and hippocampus but occurred much earlier in the PRC. A critical finding was that recognition memory-related activity occurred in different frontal and parietal regions, including the supplementary motor area, before the hippocampus. These results, based on ERP analyses, suggest that the human brain is equipped with a fast recognition memory system, which may bypass the hippocampus and in which the PRC plays a critical role.', 'Implication of folate deficiency in CYP2U1 loss of function. Hereditary spastic paraplegias are heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms remains sparse, and therapeutic options are lacking. We characterized a mouse model lacking the Cyp2u1 gene, loss of which is known to be involved in a complex form of these diseases in humans. We showed that this model partially recapitulated the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of patients. Using electron microscopy, lipidomic, and proteomic studies, we identified vitamin B2 as a substrate of the CYP2U1 enzyme, as well as coenzyme Q, neopterin, and IFN-α levels as putative biomarkers in mice and fluids obtained from the largest series of CYP2U1-mutated patients reported so far. We also confirmed brain calcifications as a potential biomarker in patients. Our results suggest that CYP2U1 deficiency disrupts mitochondrial function and impacts proper neurodevelopment, which could be prevented by folate supplementation in our mouse model, followed by a neurodegenerative process altering multiple neuronal and extraneuronal tissues.', 'Filtering in tractography using autoencoders (FINTA). Current brain white matter fiber tracking techniques show a number of problems, including: generating large proportions of streamlines that do not accurately describe the underlying anatomy; extracting streamlines that are not supported by the underlying diffusion signal; and under-representing some fiber populations, among others. In this paper, we describe a novel autoencoder-based learning method to filter streamlines from diffusion MRI tractography, and hence, to obtain more reliable tractograms. Our method, dubbed FINTA (Filtering in Tractography using Autoencoders) uses raw, unlabeled tractograms to train the autoencoder, and to learn a robust representation of brain streamlines. Such an embedding is then used to filter undesired streamline samples using a nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experiments on both synthetic and in vivo human brain diffusion MRI tractography data obtain accuracy scores exceeding the 90% threshold on the test set. Results reveal that FINTA has a superior filtering performance compared to conventional, anatomy-based methods, and the RecoBundles state-of-the-art method. Additionally, we demonstrate that FINTA can be applied to partial tractograms without requiring changes to the framework. We also show that the proposed method generalizes well across different tracking methods and datasets, and shortens significantly the computation time for large (>1 M streamlines) tractograms. Together, this work brings forward a new deep learning framework in tractography based on autoencoders, which offers a flexible and powerful method for white matter filtering and bundling that could enhance tractometry and connectivity analyses.', 'Genetic correlations and genome-wide associations of cortical structure in general population samples of 22,824 adults. Cortical thickness, surface area and volumes vary with age and cognitive function, and in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we report heritability, genetic correlations and genome-wide associations of these cortical measures across the whole cortex, and in 34 anatomically predefined regions. Our discovery sample comprises 22,824 individuals from 20 cohorts within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank. We identify genetic heterogeneity between cortical measures and brain regions, and 160 genome-wide significant associations pointing to wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β and sonic hedgehog pathways. There is enrichment for genes involved in anthropometric traits, hindbrain development, vascular and neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric conditions. These data are a rich resource for studies of the biological mechanisms behind cortical development and aging.', 'The bidirectional relation between emotional reactivity and sleep: From disruption to recovery. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and greatly affect consecutive emotional reactivity, while sleep quality itself can be strongly affected by reactions to previous emotional events. In this review, we shed light on this bidirectional relation through examples of pathology: insomnia and bipolar disorder. We show that both experimental sleep deprivation and insomnia are related to increased emotional reactivity and increased amygdala activation upon emotional stimuli presentation, and that particularly Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is important for emotional processing and reorganization of emotion-specific brain activity. Increased emotional reactivity affects REM sleep quality and sleep spindles, while REM sleep is particularly affected in insomnia, possibly related to condition-specific hyperarousal levels. Normal sleep onset deactivation of brain regions important for emotional processing (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) is further affected in insomnia. In bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances are common in both symptomatic and nonsymptomatic phases. Both amygdala and ACC volume and function are affected in bipolar disorder, with the ACC showing phase-dependent resting state activity differences. Deficient Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA-ergic activity of this region might play a role in sleep disturbances and their influence on emotional reactivity, given the inhibitory role of GABA on brain activity during sleep and its deficiency in both bipolar disorder and insomnia. Promising findings of normalizing brain activity in both insomnia and bipolar disorder upon treatment may inspire a focus on treatment studies investigating the normalization of sleep, emotional reactivity, and their corresponding brain activity patterns.', 'Neural Activity Elicited by a Cognitive Task can be Detected in Single-Trials with Simultaneous Intracerebral EEG-fMRI Recordings. Recent studies have shown that it is feasible to record simultaneously intracerebral EEG (icEEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with epilepsy. While it has mainly been used to explore the hemodynamic changes associated with epileptic spikes, this approach could also provide new insight into human cognition. However, the first step is to ensure that cognitive EEG components, that have lower amplitudes than epileptic spikes, can be appropriately detected under fMRI. We compared the high frequency activities (HFA, 50-150Hz) elicited by a reading task in icEEG-only and subsequent icEEG-fMRI in the same patients (n = 3), implanted with depth electrodes. Comparable responses were obtained, with 71% of the recording sites that responded during the icEEG-only session also responding during the icEEG-fMRI session. For all the remaining sites, nearby clusters (distant of 7mm or less) also demonstrated significant HFA increase during the icEEG-fMRI session. Significant HFA increases were also observable at the single-trial level in icEEG-fMRI recordings. Our results show that low-amplitude icEEG signal components such as cognitive-induced HFAs can be reliably recorded with simultaneous fMRI. This paves the way for the use of icEEG-fMRI to address various fundamental and clinical issues, notably the identification of the neural correlates of the BOLD signal.', 'A cortical substrate for the long-term memory of saccadic eye movements calibration. How movements are continuously adapted to physiological and environmental changes is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. While many studies have elucidated the mechanisms which underlie short-term sensorimotor adaptation (∼10–30 min), how these motor memories are maintained over longer-term (>3–5 days) -and thanks to which neural systems-is virtually unknown. Here, we examine in healthy human participants whether the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is causally involved in the induction and/or the retention of saccadic eye movements’ adaptation. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied while subjects performed a ∼15min size-decrease adaptation task of leftward reactive saccades. A TMS pulse was delivered over the TPJ in the right hemisphere (rTPJ) in each trial either 30, 60, 90 or 120 msec (in 4 separate adaptation sessions) after the saccade onset. In two control groups of subjects, the same adaptation procedure was achieved either alone (No-TMS) or combined with spTMS applied over the vertex (SHAM-TMS). While the timing of spTMS over the rTPJ did not significantly affect the speed and immediate after-effect of adaptation, we found that the amount of adaptation retention measured 10 days later was markedly larger (42%) than in both the No-TMS (21%) and the SHAM-TMS (11%) control groups. These results demonstrate for the first time that the cerebral cortex is causally involved in maintaining long-term oculomotor memories.', 'Pharmacokinetic interactions in mice between irinotecan and MBL-II-141, an ABCG2 inhibitor. Purpose. The chromone derivative MBL-II-141, specifically designed to inhibit ABCG2, was previously demonstrated to combine strong inhibition potency, low toxicity and good efficiency in reversing resistance to irinotecan in a xenografted mouse model. Here, the pharmacokinetic interactions in mice between irinotecan, its active metabolite SN-38 and MBL-II-141 were characterized quantitatively in the blood and in the brain. Methods. Compartmental models were used to fit the data. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by simulation-based diagnostic tools. Results. Irinotecan increased the MBL-II-141 apparent clearance and Vss 1.5-fold, probably by increasing the MBL-II-141 unbound fraction. MBL-II-141 decreased the total apparent clearance of irinotecan by 23%, by decreasing its biliary clearance. MBL-II-141 increased 3-fold the brain accumulation of irinotecan, as a result of the rise of systemic exposure combined with the inhibition of ABCG2-mediated efflux at the blood–brain barrier. Finally, SN-38 exposure was increased by 1.16-fold under treatment with MBL-II-141, owing to the higher irinotecan exposure with increased metabolism towards the formation of SN-38. Conclusions. These results may help to anticipate the pharmacokinetic interactions between MBL-II-141 and other ABCG2 substrates. The irinotecan-MBL-II-141 interaction is also expected to occur in humans.

It is hypothesized that iron from biological tissues, liberated during decay, may have played a role in inhibiting loss of anatomical information during fossilization of extinct organisms. Most tissues in the animal kingdom contain iron in different forms. A widely distributed iron-bearing molecule is ferritin, a globular protein that contains iron crystallites in the form of ferrihydrite minerals. Iron concentrations in ferritin are high and ferrihydrites are extremely reactive. When ancient animals are decaying on the sea floor under anoxic environmental conditions, ferrihydrites may initialize the selective replication of some tissues in pyrite FeS2. This model explains why some labile tissues are preserved, while other more resistant structures decay and are absent in many fossils. A major implication of this hypothesis is that structures described as brains in Cambrian arthropods are not fossilization artifacts, but are instead a source of information on anatomical evolution at the dawn of complex animal life.', 'Neurostructural correlates of dispositional self-compassion. Self-compassion is an important emotion regulation strategy predicting positive psychological health and fewer psychopathological problems, but little is known about its structural neural basis. In the current study, we investigated the neurostructural correlates of dispositional self-compassion and its components using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We found that self-compassion was inversely correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was primarily driven by the reduced self-judgment component. We also found that the mindfulness component was associated with greater GMV in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex and the left supplementary motor area, while the isolation and the over-identification components were both correlated with greater GMV in the right inferior temporal gyrus, and over-identification additionally related to less GMV in visual areas. Our findings suggest that dispositional self-compassion and its components are associated with brain structure in regions involved in emotion regulation, self-referential and emotion processing, with implications for the cognitive and neural mechanisms of self-compassion as well as those underlying the effects of self-compassion on its health outcomes.', \"Frequency drift in MR spectroscopy at 3T. Purpose: Heating of gradient coils and passive shim components is a common cause of instability in the B0 field, especially when gradient intensive sequences are used. The aim of the study was to set a benchmark for typical drift encountered during MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the need for real-time field-frequency locking on MRI scanners by comparing field drift data from a large number of sites. Method: A standardized protocol was developed for 80 participating sites using 99 3T MR scanners from 3 major vendors. Phantom water signals were acquired before and after an EPI sequence. The protocol consisted of: minimal preparatory imaging; a short pre-fMRI PRESS; a ten-minute fMRI acquisition; and a long post-fMRI PRESS acquisition. Both pre- and post-fMRI PRESS were non-water suppressed. Real-time frequency stabilization/adjustment was switched off when appropriate. Sixty scanners repeated the protocol for a second dataset. In addition, a three-hour post-fMRI MRS acquisition was performed at one site to observe change of gradient temperature and drift rate. Spectral analysis was performed using MATLAB. Frequency drift in pre-fMRI PRESS data were compared with the first 5:20 minutes and the full 30:00 minutes of data after fMRI. Median (interquartile range) drifts were measured and showed in violin plot. Paired t-tests were performed to compare frequency drift pre- and post-fMRI. A simulated in vivo spectrum was generated using FID-A to visualize the effect of the observed frequency drifts. The simulated spectrum was convolved with the frequency trace for the most extreme cases. Impacts of frequency drifts on NAA and GABA were also simulated as a function of linear drift. Data from the repeated protocol were compared with the corresponding first dataset using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: Of the data collected from 99 scanners, 4 were excluded due to various reasons. Thus, data from 95 scanners were ultimately analyzed. For the first 5:20 min (64 transients), median (interquartile range) drift was 0.44 (1.29) Hz before fMRI and 0.83 (1.29) Hz after. This increased to 3.15 (4.02) Hz for the full 30 min (360 transients) run. Average drift rates were 0.29 Hz/min before fMRI and 0.43 Hz/min after. Paired t-tests indicated that drift increased after fMRI, as expected (p < 0.05). Simulated spectra convolved with the frequency drift showed that the intensity of the NAA singlet was reduced by up to 26%, 44 % and 18% for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners after fMRI, respectively. ICCs indicated good agreement between datasets acquired on separate days. The single site long acquisition showed drift rate was reduced to 0.03 Hz/min approximately three hours after fMRI. Discussion: This study analyzed frequency drift data from 95 3T MRI scanners. Median levels of drift were relatively low (5-min average under 1 Hz), but the most extreme cases suffered from higher levels of drift. The extent of drift varied across scanners which both linear and nonlinear drifts were observed.\", 'Cerebral Embolism During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The BRAVO-3 MRI Study. Background Cerebral embolization is a frequent complication after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We hypothesized that cerebral embolization may be reduced by anticoagulation with bivalirudin during TAVR. Objectives This study sought to determine the proportion of patients with new cerebral embolus after TAVR and to investigate whether parenteral procedural anticoagulation strategies affect cerebral embolization. Methods The BRAVO (Effect of Bivalirudin on Aortic Valve Intervention Outcomes)-3 randomized trial compared bivalirudin with unfractionated heparin in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. A prospective cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy was conducted in 4 sites; 60 patients were imaged with brain MRI after TAVR. Primary endpoint was proportion of patients with new cerebral emboli on MRI. Secondary endpoints included quantitative MRI analyses of cerebral lesions and neurological outcomes at 48 h and 30 days. Results Patients were randomized to bivalirudin (n = 29) versus heparin (n = 31). The proportion of patients with new cerebral emboli on MRI did not differ between bivalirudin and heparin groups (65.5% vs. 58.1%; p = 0.55). Groups were similar for median number of emboli per patient (1 [interquartile range (IQR): 0 to 3] vs. 1 [IQR: 0 to 1]; p = 0.08), total volume of emboli (45 [IQR: 0 to 175] mm3 vs. 33 [IQR: 0 to 133] mm3; p = 0.86), or proportion of patients with a clinical neurological deficit at 48 h or 30 days. All patients who presented clinically with stroke had evidence of new emboli on MRI. Conclusions This study documented cerebral embolization in nearly two-thirds of patients during contemporary TAVR. There were no significant differences in cerebral embolization for bivalirudin versus heparin anticoagulation during TAVR.

Objectives Neurofeedback is a technique that aims to teach a subject to regulate a brain parameter measured by a technical interface to modulate his/her related brain and cognitive activities. However, the use of neurofeedback as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders remains controversial. The aim of this review is to summarize and to comment the level of evidence of electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback and real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback for therapeutic application in psychiatry. Method Literature on neurofeedback and mental disorders but also on brain computer interfaces (BCI) used in the field of neurocognitive science has been considered by the group of expert of the Neurofeedback evaluation & training (NExT) section of the French Association of biological psychiatry and neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN). Results Results show a potential efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in the treatment of attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, even if this is still debated. For other mental disorders, there is too limited research to warrant the use of EEG-neurofeedback in clinical practice. Regarding fMRI neurofeedback, the level of evidence remains too weak, for now, to justify clinical use. The literature review highlights various unclear points, such as indications (psychiatric disorders, pathophysiologic rationale), protocols (brain signals targeted, learning characteristics) and techniques (EEG, fMRI, signal processing). Conclusion The field of neurofeedback involves psychiatrists, neurophysiologists and researchers in the field of brain computer interfaces. Future studies should determine the criteria for optimizing neurofeedback sessions. A better understanding of the learning processes underpinning neurofeedback could be a key element to develop the use of this technique in clinical practice.\", 'Selective serotonin 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor biased agonists elicitdistinct brain activation patterns: A pharmacoMRI study. Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors are involved in several physiological and pathological processes and constitute therefore an important therapeutic target. The recent pharmacological concept of biased agonism asserts that highly selective agonists can preferentially direct receptor signaling to specific intracellular responses, opening the possibility of drugs targeting a receptor subtype in specific brain regions. The present study brings additional support to this concept thanks to functional magnetic resonance imaging (7 Tesla-fMRI) in anaesthetized rats. Three 5-HT1A receptor agonists (8-OH-DPAT, F13714 and F15599) and one 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (MPPF) were compared in terms of influence on the brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Our study revealed for the first time contrasting BOLD signal patterns of biased agonists in comparison to a classical agonist and a silent antagonist. By providing functional information on the influence of pharmacological activation of 5-HT1A receptors in specific brain regions, this neuroimaging approach, translatable to the clinic, promises to be useful in exploring the new concept of biased agonism in neuropsychopharmacology.', 'Longitudinal associations of physical activity levels with morphological and functional changes related with aging: The MAPT study. Introduction: The biological process of aging is characterized by molecular and physiological processes that lead to alterations in the organism. There is still a lack of a consensus about the measurement of biological aging, but physical activity (PA) could be a potential marker of an aging phenotype. Methods: Measurements of body composition, muscle quality (MQ), blood biochemistry, and neurodegeneration were assessed over three years. Physical activity levels were measured using a self-reported questionnaire. Results: Three-year progression of PA levels showed that those who maintained low levels of PA was significantly associated with the evolution of brain and hippocampal volume, compared to inactive individuals. Similar results were found always active individuals, but also had better cognition. Conclusion: PA levels are associated with some elements of biological aging, but more studies with objective-based PA measurements could provide a more in-depth knowledge on biological aging.', 'Biological and imaging predictors of cognitive impairment after stroke: a systematic review. Background: Cognitive impairment is frequent after stroke, and several studies have suggested that biological and imaging characteristics present before stroke are associated with the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment. Objective: The aim of our study was to systematically review biological and imaging predictors of cognitive impairment after stroke. Method: Studies were identified from bibliographic databases and reference lists, and were included if conducted in patients with acute stroke, with at least 30 patients, and a follow-up of at least 3\\xa0months. We included articles on potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment that pre-existed to stroke. Results: We identified 22,169 articles, including 20,349 with abstract. After analysis, 66 studies conducted in 42 cohorts met selection criteria. They included 30–9522 patients [median 170; interquartile range (IQR) 104–251] with a median follow-up of 12\\xa0months (IQR 3–36). All studies met quality criteria for description of the study population and standardization of biomarkers. Twenty-nine studies met all quality criteria. There was no convincing evidence that any biological marker may predict cognitive impairment. The most consistent predictors of cognitive impairment after stroke were global atrophy and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Conclusion: Pre-existing cerebral atrophy is the most consistent predictor of cognitive impairment that can be identified in patients with an acute stroke.', 'An Open Resource for Non-human Primate Imaging. Non-human primate neuroimaging is a rapidly growing area of research that promises to transform and scale translational and cross-species comparative neuroscience. Unfortunately, the technological and methodological advances of the past two decades have outpaced the accrual of data, which is particularly challenging given the relatively few centers that have the necessary facilities and capabilities. The PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) addresses this challenge by aggregating independently acquired non-human primate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and openly sharing them via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI). Here, we present the rationale, design, and procedures for the PRIME-DE consortium, as well as the initial release, consisting of 25 independent data collections aggregated across 22 sites (total = 217 non-human primates). We also outline the unique pitfalls and challenges that should be considered in the analysis of non-human primate MRI datasets, including providing automated quality assessment of the contributed datasets. The PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) consortium is an open science resource for the neuroimaging community aiming to facilitate efforts to map the non-human primate connectome. It aggregates and shares anatomical, functional, and diffusion MRI datasets from laboratories throughout the world.', 'Data augmentation using generative adversarial neural networks on brain structural connectivity in multiple sclerosis. Background and objective:Machine learning frameworks have demonstrated their potentials in dealing with complex data structures, achieving remarkable results in many areas, including brain imaging. However, a large collection of data is needed to train these models. This is particularly challenging in the biomedical domain since, due to acquisition accessibility, costs and pathology related variability, available datasets are limited and usually imbalanced. To overcome this challenge, generative models can be used to generate new data. Methods: In this study, a framework based on generative adversarial network is proposed to create synthetic structural brain networks in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The dataset consists of 29 relapsing-remitting and 19 secondary-progressive MS patients. T1 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisitions were used to obtain the structural brain network for each subject. Evaluation of the quality of newly generated brain networks is performed by (i) analysing their structural properties and (ii) studying their impact on classification performance. Results: We demonstrate that advanced generative models could be directly applied to the structural brain networks. We quantitatively and qualitatively show that newly generated data do not present significant differences compared to the real ones. In addition, augmenting the existing dataset with generated samples leads to an improvement of the classification performance (F1score 81%) with respect to the baseline approach (F1score 66%). Conclusions: Our approach defines a new tool for biomedical application when connectome-based data augmentation is needed, providing a valid alternative to usual image-based data augmentation techniques.', 'Progesterone decreases apnoea and reduces oxidative stress induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia in ovariectomized female rats. New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Does progesterone reduce the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on arterial blood pressure, respiratory control and oxidative stress in the central nervous system in ovariectomized rats? What is the main finding and its importance? Progesterone does not prevent the elevation of arterial blood pressure in rats exposed to CIH, but normalizes respiratory control, and reduces cerebral oxidative stress. This study draws focus to a potential role of progesterone and the consequences of sleep apnoea in menopausal women. Abstract: We tested the hypothesis that progesterone (Prog) reduces the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on arterial blood pressure, respiratory chemoreflexes and oxidative stress in the central nervous system. Ovariectomized female rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle (Veh) or Prog (4\\xa0mg\\xa0kg−1\\xa0day−1). Two weeks following the surgery, rats were exposed to room air (Air) or CIH (7\\xa0days, 10% O2, 10 cycles\\xa0h−1, 8\\xa0h\\xa0day−1). We studied three groups: Veh–Air, Veh–CIH and Prog–CIH. After the CIH exposures, we measured the mean arterial pressure (MAP; tail cuff) and assessed the frequency of apnoeas at rest and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (whole body plethysmography). The activities of the pro-oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD; in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, were measured in brain cortex and brainstem samples. CIH exposure increased the MAP, the frequency of apnoeas, and the respiratory frequency response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Prog did not prevent the CIH-induced elevation in MAP, but it reduced the CIH-induced frequency of apnoeas and increased hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses. In the brain cortex, CIH increased NOX activity, and decreased the cytosolic and mitochondrial SOD activities. These effects were prevented by Prog. NOX activity was increased by CIH in the brainstem, and this was also blocked by Prog. The study draws focus to the links between ovarian hormones and the consequences of sleep apnoea in women.', 'Eicosapentaenoic acid modulates the synergistic action of CREB1 and ID/E2A family members in the rat pup brain and mouse embryonic stem cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may exert neuroprotective effects through an “EPA-cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)” signaling pathway. The current study reveals that EPA modulates the exquisite interplay of interaction of CREB1 with the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) and E2A family members, thereby delivering mechanistic insights into specific neural differentiation program. In this scenario, our work provides evidence for the capability of CREB1 to sequester ID:E2A family members in brain tissues and neural differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) through formation of a [CREB1]2:ID2:E47 tetrameric complex.In essence, the molecular function of CREB1 is to dynamically regulate the location-specific assembly or disassembly of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH):HLH protein complexes to mediate the activation of neural/glial target genes. Together, these findings support the one-to-many binding mechanism of CREB1 and indicate that EPA treatment potentiates the integration of CREB dependent signaling with HLH/bHLH transcriptional network, adding specificity to the CREB1-mediated gene regulation during neural/glial differentiation. Our current research on the EPA-CREB axis could reveal new molecular targets for treating neurogenerative disease.', 'Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke related to carotid artery occlusion. Background The aetiology of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke remains speculative. It is however widely accepted that the aetiology is multifactorial, involving various maternal, placental, foetal and neonatal risk factors. A resulting thromboembolic process is hypothesized and the placenta identified as the most plausible source. An arteriopathy, as observed in a significant proportion of childhood ischemic stroke, is thought to be rare. Methods We report here five cases of perinatal stroke that differ from the vast majority by documented carotid occlusion, and add eleven other similar cases from the literature. Results In the majority, an intraluminal thrombus of placental origin is the most probable hypothesis, while in the remaining ones, one can reasonably presume a direct vessel wall injury related to a traumatic delivery, yet generally unproven by imaging. Conclusion We hypothesize that most of these cases share similar pathophysiology with the more common perinatal arterial ischemic stroke but differ by a persistent identified thrombus in the carotid artery at the time of first imaging, leading to a more severe and extended ischemic damage responsible for an adverse neurological outcome.', 'The Impact of Compressed Femtosecond Laser Pulse Durations on Neuronal Tissue Used for Two-Photon Excitation Through an Endoscope. Accurate intraoperative tumour margin assessment is a major challenge in neurooncology, where sparse tumours beyond the bulk tumour are left undetected under conventional resection. Non-linear optical imaging can diagnose tissue at the sub-micron level and provide functional label-free histopathology in vivo. For this reason, a non-linear endomicroscope is being developed to characterize brain tissue intraoperatively based on multiple endogenous optical contrasts such as spectrally- and temporally-resolved fluorescence. To produce highly sensitive optical signatures that are specific to a given tissue type, short femtosecond pulsed lasers are required for efficient two-photon excitation. Yet, the potential of causing bio-damage has not been studied on neuronal tissue. Therefore, as a prerequisite to clinically testing the non-linear endomicroscope in vivo, the effect of short laser pulse durations (40–340 fs) on ex vivo brain tissue was investigated by monitoring the intensity, the spectral, and the lifetime properties of endogenous fluorophores under 800 and 890 nm two-photon excitation using a bi-modal non-linear endoscope. These properties were also validated by imaging samples on a benchtop multiphoton microscope. Our results show that under a constant mean laser power, excitation pulses as short as 40 fs do not negatively alter the biochemical/ biophysical properties of tissue even for prolonged irradiation.', 'Role of inter-hemispheric connections in functional brain networks. Today the human brain can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent different regions and links stand for statistical interactions between their activities as recorded by different neuroimaging techniques. Empirical studies have lead to the hypothesis that brain functions rely on the coordination of a scattered mosaic of functionally specialized brain regions (modules or sub-networks), forming a web-like structure of coordinated assemblies (a network of networks. NoN). The study of brain dynamics would therefore benefit from an inspection of how functional sub-networks interact between them. In this paper, we model the brain as an interconnected system composed of two specific sub-networks, the left (L) and right (R) hemispheres, which compete with each other for centrality, a topological measure of importance in a networked system. Specifically, we considered functional scalp EEG networks (SEN) derived from high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and investigated how node centrality is shaped by interhemispheric connections. Our results show that the distribution of centrality strongly depends on the number of functional connections between hemispheres and the way these connections are distributed. Additionally, we investigated the consequences of node failure on hemispherical centrality, and showed how the abundance of inter-hemispheric links favors the functional balance of centrality distribution between the hemispheres.', \"AMPK in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by a progressive degeneration of nerve cells eventually leading to dementia. While these diseases affect different neuronal populations and present distinct clinical features, they share in common several features and signaling pathways. In particular, energy metabolism defects, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity are commonly described and might be correlated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) deregulation. AMPK is a master energy sensor which was reported to be overactivated in the brain of patients affected by these neurodegenerative disorders. While the exact role played by AMPK in these diseases remains to be clearly established, several studies reported the implication of AMPK in various signaling pathways that are involved in these diseases' progression. In this chapter, we review the current literature regarding the involvement of AMPK in the development of these diseases and discuss the common pathways involved.\", \"Neural correlates of visuoperceptive changes in severe alcohol use disorder: A critical review of neuroimaging and electrophysiological findings. Visuoperceptive deficits are frequently reported in severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) and are considered as pervasive and persistent in time. While this topic of investigation has previously driven researchers' interest, far fewer studies have focused on visuoperception in SAUD since the ‘90s, leaving open central questions regarding the origin and implications of these deficits. To renew research in the field and provide a solid background to work upon, this paper reviews the neural correlates of visuoperception in SAUD, based on data from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Results reveal structural and functional changes within the visual system but also in the connections between occipital and frontal areas. We highlight the lack of integration of these findings in the dominant models of vision which stress the dynamic nature of the visual system and consider the presence of both bottom-up and top-down cerebral mechanisms. Visuoperceptive changes are also discussed in the framework of long-lasting debates regarding the influence of demographic and alcohol-related factors, together stressing the presence of inter-individual differences. Capitalizing on this review, we provide guidelines to inform future research, and ultimately improve clinical care.\", \"Brain insulin signaling and Tau: Impact for Alzheimer's disease and Tauopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropathological lesions such as Tau aggregates and amyloid plaques, but also associated with metabolic and neuroendocrine abnormalities, such as impairment of cerebral insulin. However, the origin of these symptoms and their relationship to pathology and cognitive disorders remain poorly understood. Insulin is a hormone involved in the control of peripheral and central energy homeostasis, and insulin-resistant state has been linked to increased risk of dementia. It is now well established that brain insulin resistance can exacerbate Tau lesions. Conversely, recent data indicate that Tau protein can modulate insulin signalling in the brain, creating a vicious circle precipitating the pathological AD. This review aims to highlight our current understanding of the role of insulin in the brain and its relationship with Tau protein in the context of AD and Tauopathies.\", 'Comparison of endothelial promoter efficiency and specificity in mice reveals a subset of Pdgfb-positive hematopoietic cells. Essentials To reliably study the respective roles of blood and endothelial cells in hemostasis, mouse models with a strong and specific endothelial expression of the Cre recombinase are needed. Using mT/mG reporter mice and conditional JAK2 V617F/WT mice, we compared Pdgfb-iCreERT2 and Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 with well-characterized Tie2-Cre mice. Comparison of recombination efficiency and specificity towards blood lineage reveals major differences between endothelial transgenic mice. Cre-mediated recombination occurs in a small number of adult hematopoietic stem cells in Pdgfb-iCreERT2;JAK2 V617F/WT transgenic mice. Summary: Background The vessel wall, and particularly blood endothelial cells (BECs), are intensively studied to better understand hemostasis and target thrombosis. To understand the specific role of BECs, it is important to have mouse models that allow specific and homogeneous expression of genes of interest in all BEC beds without concomitant expression in blood cells. Inducible Pdgfb-iCreERT2 and Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 transgenic mice are widely used for BEC targeting. However, issues remain in terms of recombination efficiency and specificity regarding hematopoietic cells. Objectives To determine which mouse model to choose when strong expression of a transgene is required in adult BECs from various organs, without concomitant expression in hematopoietic cells. Methods Using mT/mG reporter mice to measure recombination efficiency and conditional JAK2 V617F/WT mice to assess specificity regarding hematopoietic cells, we compared Pdgfb-iCreERT2 and Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 with well-characterized Tie2-Cre mice. Results Adult Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 mice are endothelial specific but require a dose of 10\\xa0mg of tamoxifen to allow constant Cre expression. Pdgfb-iCreERT2 mice injected with 5\\xa0mg of tamoxifen are appropriate for most endothelial research fields except liver studies, as hepatic sinusoid ECs are not recombined. Surprisingly, 2\\xa0months after induction of Cre-mediated recombination, all Pdgfb-iCreERT2;JAK2 V617F/WT mice developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm that is related to the presence of JAK2V617F in hematopoietic cells, showing for the first time that Cre-mediated recombination occurs in a small number of adult hematopoietic stem cells in Pdgfb-iCreERT2 transgenic mice. Conclusion This study provides useful guidelines for choosing the best mouse line to study the role of BECs in hemostasis and thrombosis.', 'Clinical and molecular description of 19 patients with GATAD2B-Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorder (GAND). De novo pathogenic variants in the GATAD2B gene have been associated with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder (GAND) characterized by severe intellectual disability (ID), impaired speech, childhood hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. Since its first description in 2013, nine patients have been reported in case reports and a series of 50 patients was recently published, which is consistent with the relative frequency of GATAD2B pathogenic variants in public databases. We report the detailed phenotype of 19 patients from various ethnic backgrounds with confirmed pathogenic GATAD2B variants including intragenic deletions. All individuals presented developmental delay with a median age of 2.5 years for independent walking and of 3 years for first spoken words. GATAD2B variant carriers showed very little subsequent speech progress, two patients over 30 years of age remaining non-verbal. ID was mostly moderate to severe, with one profound and one mild case, which shows a wider spectrum of disease severity than previously reported. We confirm macrocephaly as a major feature in GAND (53%). Most common dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, wide nasal base, and pointed chin. Conversely, prenatal abnormalities, non-cerebral malformations, epilepsy, and autistic behavior were uncommon. Other features included feeding difficulties, behavioral abnormalities, and unspecific abnormalities on brain MRI. Improving our knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for correct interpretation of the molecular results and accurate patient management.', 'Narcolepsy — clinical spectrum, aetiopathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Narcolepsy is a rare brain disorder that reflects a selective loss or dysfunction of orexin (also known as\\xa0hypocretin) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, accompanied by sleep–wake symptoms, such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed sleep. Diagnosis is based on these clinical features and supported by biomarkers: evidence of rapid eye movement sleep periods soon after sleep onset; cerebrospinal fluid orexin deficiency; and positivity for HLA-DQB1*06:02. Symptomatic treatment with stimulant and anticataplectic drugs is usually efficacious. This Review focuses on\\xa0our current understanding of how genetic, environmental and immune-related factors contribute to a prominent (but not isolated) orexin signalling deficiency in patients with NT1. Data supporting the view of NT1 as a hypothalamic disorder affecting not only sleep–wake but also motor, psychiatric, emotional, cognitive, metabolic and autonomic functions are presented, along with uncertainties concerning the ‘narcoleptic borderland’, including narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). The limitations of current diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy are discussed, and a possible new classification system incorporating the borderland conditions is presented. Finally, advances and obstacles in the symptomatic and causal treatment of narcolepsy are reviewed.', \"Odorants: a tool to provide nonpharmacological intervention to reduce anxiety during normal and pathological aging. Anxiety disorders represent 1 of the most common classes of psychiatric disorders. In the aging population and for patients with age-related pathology, the percentage of people suffering of anxiety is significantly elevated. Furthermore, anxiety carries with it an increased risk for a variety of age-related medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, cognitive decline, and increased severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A variety of anxiolytic compounds are available but often carry with them disturbing side effects that impact quality of life. Among nonmedicinal approaches to reducing anxiety, odor diffusion and aromatherapy are the most popular. In this review, we highlight the emerging perspective that the use of odorants may reduce anxiety symptoms or at least potentiate the effect of other anxiolytic approaches and may serve as an alternative form of therapy to deal with anxiety symptoms. Such approaches may be particularly beneficial in aging populations with elevated risk for these disorders. We also discuss potential neural mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of odorants based on work in animal models.\", 'Direct Lineage Reprogramming for Brain Repair: Breakthroughs and Challenges. Injury to the human central nervous system (CNS) is devastating because our adult mammalian brain lacks intrinsic regenerative capacity to replace lost neurons and induce functional recovery. An emerging approach towards brain repair is to instruct fate conversion of brain-resident non-neuronal cells into induced neurons (iNs) by direct lineage reprogramming. Considerable progress has been made in converting various source cell types of mouse and human origin into clinically relevant iNs. Recent achievements using transcriptomics and epigenetics have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning neuronal reprogramming, while the potential capability of iNs in promoting functional recovery in pathological contexts has started to be evaluated. Although future challenges need to be overcome before clinical translation, lineage reprogramming holds promise for effective cell-replacement therapy in regenerative medicine.', 'Individualized quantification of the benefit from reperfusion therapy using stroke predictive models. Purpose: Recent imaging developments have shown the potential of voxel-based models in assessing infarct growth after stroke. Many models have been proposed but their relevance in predicting the benefit of a reperfusion therapy remains unclear. We searched for a predictive model whose volumetric predictions would identify stroke patients who are to benefit from tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-induced reperfusion. Material and Methods: Forty-five cases were used to study retrospectively stroke progression from admission to end of follow-up. Predictive approaches based on various statistical models, predictive variables and spatial filtering methods were compared. The optimal approach was chosen according to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The final lesion volume was then predicted assuming that the patient would or would not reperfuse. Patients, with an acute lesion of ≤50\\xa0ml and a predicted reduction in the presence of reperfusion >6\\xa0ml and >25% of the acute lesion, were classified as responders. Results: The optimal model was a logistic regression using the voxel distance to the acute lesion, the volume of the acute lesion and Gaussian-filtered MRI contrast parameters as predictive variables. The predictions gave a median AUPRC of 0.655, a median AUC of 0.976 and a median volumetric error of 8.29\\xa0ml. Nineteen patients matched the responder profile. A non-significant trend of improved reduction in NIHSS score (−42.8%, p\\xa0=.09) and in lesion volume (−78.1%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.21) following reperfusion was observed for responder patients. Conclusion: Despite limited volumetric accuracy, predictive stroke models can be used to quantify the benefit of reperfusion therapies.', \"The standardization of cerebrospinal fluid markers and neuropathological diagnoses brings to light the frequent complexity of concomitant pathology in Alzheimer's disease: The next challenge for biochemical markers?. During the last two decades, neuropathological examination of the brain has evolved both technically and scientifically. The increasing use of immunohistochemistry to detect protein aggregates paralleled a better understanding of neuroanatomical progression of protein deposition. As a consequence, an international effort was achieved to standardize hyperphosphorylated-Tau (phospho-TAU), ßAmyloid (Aß), alpha syncuclein (alpha-syn), phosphorylated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (phospho-TDP43) and vascular pathology detection. Meanwhile harmonized staging systems emerged in order to increase inter rater reproducibility. Therefore, a refined definition of Alzheimer's disease was recommended., a clearer picture of the neuropathological lesions diversity emerged secondarily to the systematic assessment of concomitant pathology highlighting finally a low rate of pure AD pathology. This brings new challenges to laboratory medicine in the field of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease: how to further validate total Tau, phospho-TAU, Aß40 and Aß42 and new marker level cut-offs while autopsy rates are declining?\", \"Differential default mode network trajectories in asymptomatic individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Introduction: The longitudinal trajectories of functional brain dynamics and the impact of genetic risk factors in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease are poorly understood. Methods: In a large-scale monocentric cohort of 224 amyloid stratified individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease, default mode network (DMN) resting state functional connectivity (FC) was investigated between two serial time points across 2 years. Results: Widespread DMN FC changes were shown in frontal and posterior areas, as well as in the right hippocampus. There were no cross-sectional differences, however, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) carriers demonstrated slower increase in FC in frontal lobes. There was no impact of individual brain amyloid load status. Discussion: For the first time, we demonstrated that the pleiotropic biological effect of the APOE ε4 allele impacts the dynamic trajectory of the DMN during aging. Dynamic functional biomarkers may become useful surrogate outcomes for the development of preclinical targeted therapeutic interventions.\", \"An information-theoretic perspective on the costs of cognition. In statistics and machine learning, model accuracy is traded off with complexity, which can be viewed as the amount of information extracted from the data. Here, we discuss how cognitive costs can be expressed in terms of similar information costs, i.e. as a function of the amount of information required to update a person's prior knowledge (or internal model) to effectively solve a task. We then examine the theoretical consequences that ensue from this assumption. This framework naturally explains why some tasks – for example, unfamiliar or dual tasks – are costly and permits to quantify these costs using information-theoretic measures. Finally, we discuss brain implementation of this principle and show that subjective cognitive costs can originate either from local or global capacity limitations on information processing or from increased rate of metabolic alterations. These views shed light on the potential adaptive value of cost-avoidance mechanisms.\", 'MitoBrain, Putting energy into the brain. ', \"Permeability of blood-brain barrier in macaque model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinson disease. Brain bioavailability of drugs developed to address central nervous system diseases is classically documented through cerebrospinal fluid collected in normal animals, i.e., through an approximation as there are fundamental differences between cerebrospinal fluid and tissue contents. The fact that disease might affect brain availability of drugs is almost never considered at this stage although several conditions are associated with blood-brain barrier damage. Building upon our expertise in Parkinson's disease translational research, the present study addressed this gap comparing plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bioavailability of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, carbamazepine, quinidine, lovastatin, and simvastatin, in healthy and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated macaques, the gold standard model of Parkinson's disease. The drugs were selected based upon their differential transport across the blood-brain barrier. Interestingly, brain bioavailability of quinidine was decreased while others were unaffected. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics experiments of drugs addressing Parkinson's disease might thus be performed in healthy animals unless the drugs are known to interact with the organic cation transporter. Synapse 70:231-239, 2016. As a pathological state may compromise drug brain bioavailability, we measured the plasma and cerebro-spinal fluid levels of L-DOPA, carbamazepine, quinidine, lovastatin and simvastatin in normal and parkinsonian (MPTP) macaque monkeys. Since no major bioavailability differences were observed, we conclude that brain bioavailability can be studied in normal monkeys.\", \"Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease Patients at Prodromal Stage. One objective of modern neuroimaging is to identify markers that can aid in diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and impact long-term drug analysis. In this study, physiopathological modifications in seven subcortical structures of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) were characterized by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters that are sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics (e.g., volume atrophy, shape changes, microstructural damage, and iron deposition). Fourteen MCI patients and fourteen matched, healthy subjects underwent 3T-magnetic resonance imaging with whole-brain, T1-weighted, T2∗-weighted, and diffusion-tensor imaging scans. Volume, shape, mean R2∗, mean diffusivity (MD), and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in the thalamus, hippocampus, putamen, amygdala, caudate nucleus, pallidum, and accumbens were compared between MCI patients and healthy subjects. Comparisons were then performed using voxel-based analyses of R2∗, MD, FA maps, and voxel-based morphometry to determine which subregions showed the greatest difference for each parameter. With respect to the micro- and macro-structural patterns of damage, our results suggest that different and distinct physiopathological processes are present in the prodromal phase of AD. MCI patients had significant atrophy and microstructural changes within their hippocampi and amygdalae, which are known to be affected in the prodromal stage of AD. This suggests that the amygdala is affected in the same, direct physiopathological process as the hippocampus. Conversely, atrophy alone was observed within the thalamus and putamen, which are not directly involved in AD pathogenesis. This latter result may reflect another mechanism, whereby atrophy is linked to indirect physiopathological processes.\", \"Joint Assessment of Quantitative <sup>18</sup> F-Florbetapir and <sup>18</sup> F-FDG Regional Uptake Using Baseline Data from the ADNI. Joint analysis of amyloid and metabolic PET patterns across healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects was performed using baseline 18 F-florbetapir and 18 F-FDG PET of 684 subjects from the ADNI (251 normal, 204 stable MCI, 85 AD converters, and 144 AD). Correlation between regional amyloid and metabolic uptake was measured and predictive value of PET profile regarding AD conversion in cognitively impaired subjects was assessed using survival analysis and support vector machine classification (SVM). The highest correlations were found in the temporal cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulum. With respect to normal controls, amyloid load increase was diffuse and early in MCI subjects, whereas metabolism decrease occurred later and predominated in temporo-parietal, precuneus, and cingulate cortices. Five-year AD conversion rates in cognitively impaired subjects were 5, 22, 42, and 78 in amyloid-/FDG-, amyloid-/FDG, amyloid/FDG-, and amyloid/FDG subjects respectively (mean follow-up 37±14 months). Using SVM, the combination of ADAS-cog score, amyloid PET, and FDG PET yielded better performance in predicting AD conversion (77 accuracy; 58 positive predictive value; 88 negative predictive value) than ADAS-cog (72; 52; 86), amyloid PET (72; 52; 87), and FDG PET (67; 47; 84). This study attests the complementary value of amyloid and FDG PET in MCI assessment and the efficiency of combined cognitive, amyloid, and metabolic scores to predict AD conversion.\", 'Coupled brain and urine spectroscopy - in vivo metabolomic characterization of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency in 5 patients. Background 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lyase deficiency is a rare inborn error of leucine metabolism and ketogenesis. Despite recurrent hypoglycemia and metabolic decompensations, most patients have a good clinical and neurological outcome contrasting with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals and consistent abnormal brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) metabolite peaks. Identifying these metabolites could provide surrogate markers of the disease and improve understanding of MRI-clinical discrepancy and follow-up of affected patients. Methods Urine samples, brain MRI and 1H-MRS in 5 patients with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency (4 boys and 1 girl aged from 25\\xa0days to 10\\xa0years) were, for each patient, obtained on the same day. Brain and urine spectroscopy were performed at the same pH by studying urine at pH 7.4. Due to pH-induced modifications in chemical shifts and because reference 1H NMR spectra are obtained at pH 2.5, spectroscopy of normal urine added with the suspected metabolite was further performed at this pH to validate the correct identification of compounds. Results Mild to extended abnormal white matter MRI signals were observed in all cases. Brain spectroscopy abnormal peaks at 0.8–1.1\\xa0ppm, 1.2–1.4\\xa0ppm and 2.4\\xa0ppm were also detected by urine spectroscopy at pH 7.4. Taking into account pH-induced changes in chemical shifts, brain abnormal peaks in patients were formally identified to be those of 3-hydroxyisovaleric, 3-methylglutaconic, 3-methylglutaric and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acids. Conclusion 3-Methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acids identified on urine 1H-NMR spectra of 5 patients with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency are responsible for the cerebral spectroscopy signature seen in these patients, validating their local involvement in brain and putative contribution to brain neuropathology.', 'Brain gray matter MRI morphometry for neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest. Objectives: We hypothesize that the combined use of MRI cortical thickness measurement and subcortical gray matter volumetry could provide an early and accurate in vivo assessment of the structural impact of cardiac arrest and therefore could be used for long-term neuroprognostication in this setting. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Five Intensive Critical Care Units affiliated to the University in Toulouse (France), Paris (France), Clermont-Ferrand (France), Liège (Belgium), and Monza (Italy). Patients: High-resolution anatomical T1-weighted images were acquired in 126 anoxic coma patients (\"learning\" sample) 16 ± 8 days after cardiac arrest and 70 matched controls. An additional sample of 18 anoxic coma patients, recruited in Toulouse, was used to test predictive model generalization (\"test\" sample). All patients were followed up 1 year after cardiac arrest. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Cortical thickness was computed on the whole cortical ribbon, and deep gray matter volumetry was performed after automatic segmentation. Brain morphometric data were employed to create multivariate predictive models using learning machine techniques. Patients displayed significantly extensive cortical and subcortical brain volumes atrophy compared with controls. The accuracy of a predictive classifier, encompassing cortical and subcortical components, has a significant discriminative power (learning area under the curve = 0.87; test area under the curve = 0.96). The anatomical regions which volume changes were significantly related to patient\\'s outcome were frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, putamen, pallidum, caudate, hippocampus, and brain stem. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of pathologic disruption of a striatopallidal-thalamo-cortical mesocircuit induced by cardiac arrest and pave the way for the use of combined brain quantitative morphometry in this setting.', \"In utero delivery of rAAV2/9 induces neuronal expression of the transgene in the brain: Towards new models of Parkinson's disease. Animal models are essential tools for basic pathophysiological research as well as validation of therapeutic strategies for curing human diseases. However, technical difficulties associated with classical transgenesis approaches in rodent species higher than Mus musculus have prevented this long-awaited development. The availability of viral-mediated gene delivery systems in the past few years has stimulated the production of viruses with unique characteristics. For example, the recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV2/9) crosses the blood-brain barrier, is capable of transducing developing cells and neurons after intravenous injection and mediates long-term transduction. Whilst post-natal delivery is technically straightforward, in utero delivery bears the potential of achieving gene transduction in neurons at embryonic stages during which the target area is undergoing development. To test this possibility, we injected rAAV2/9 carrying either A53T mutant human α-synuclein or green fluorescent protein, intracerebroventricularly in rats at embryonic day 16.5. We observed neuronal transgene expression in most regions of the brain at 1 and 3 months after birth. This proof-of-concept experiment introduces a new opportunity to model brain diseases in rats.\", 'SYNGAP1-DEE: A visual sensitive epilepsy. Objective: To further delineate the electroclinical features of individuals with SYNGAP1 pathogenic variants. Methods: Participants with pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants and available video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were recruited within five European epilepsy reference centers. We obtained molecular and clinical data, analyzed EEG recordings and archived video-EEGs of seizures and detailed characteristics of interictal and ictal EEG patterns for every patient. Results: We recruited 15 previously unreported patients and analyzed 72 EEGs. Two distinct EEG patterns emerged, both triggered by eye closure. Pattern 1 (14/15 individuals) consisted of rhythmic posterior/diffuse delta waves appearing with eye-closure and persisting until eye opening (strongly suggestive of fixation-off sensitivity). Pattern 2 (9/15 individuals) consisted of diffuse polyspike-and-wave discharges triggered by eye closure (eye-closure sensitivity). Both patterns presented in 8/15. Including archived video-EEG clips of seizures from 9/15 patients, we analyzed 254 seizures. Of 224 seizures experienced while awake, 161 (72%) occurred at or following eye closure. In 119/161, pattern 1 preceded an atypical absence, myoclonic seizure or myoclonic absence; in 42/161, pattern 2 was associated with eyelid myoclonia, absences and myoclonic or atonic seizures. Conclusions: Fixation-off and eye closure were the main triggers for seizures in this SYNGAP1 cohort. Significance: Combining these clinical and electroencephalographic features could help guide genetic diagnosis.', 'Self-similarity and multifractality in human brain activity: A wavelet-based analysis of scale-free brain dynamics. Background: The temporal structure of macroscopic brain activity displays both oscillatory and scale-free dynamics. While the functional relevance of neural oscillations has been largely investigated, both the nature and the role of scale-free dynamics in brain processing have been disputed. New method: Here, we offer a novel method to rigorously enrich the characterization of scale-free brain activity using a robust wavelet-based assessment of self-similarity and multifractality. For this, we analyzed human brain activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants were at rest or performing a visual motion discrimination task. Results: First, we report consistent infraslow (from 0.1 to 1.5 Hz) scale-free dynamics (i.e., self-similarity and multifractality) in resting-state and task data. Second, we observed a fronto-occipital gradient of self-similarity reminiscent of the known hierarchy of temporal scales from sensory to higher-order cortices; the anatomical gradient was more pronounced in task than in rest. Third, we observed a significant increase of multifractality during task as compared to rest. Additionally, the decrease in self-similarity and the increase in multifractality from rest to task were negatively correlated in regions involved in the task, suggesting a shift from structured global temporal dynamics in resting-state to locally bursty and non Gaussian scale-free structures during task. Comparison with existing method(s): We showed that the wavelet leader based multifractal approach extends power spectrum estimation methods in the way of characterizing finely scale-free brain dynamics. Conclusions: Altogether, our approach provides novel fine-grained characterizations of scale-free dynamics in human brain activity.', \"Alzheimer's disease and Helicobacter pylori infection: A possible link?. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with Aß peptide and Tau protein deposits, but the initial process inducing the disease and ultimately neurodegeneration has not yet been elucidated. An infectious hypothesis is suggested by the alteration of the blood-brain barrier and the activation of neuroinflammation in the brain, which could play a role, especially in the decrease of Aß peptide clearance. Several viral or bacterial agents have been incriminated, including Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is acquired during childhood and often lifetime persisting, inducing a chronic gastric inflammation, which remains asymptomatic in approximately 80% of cases. However H. pylori infection can induce systemic inflammation and increase homocysteine levels, contributing to worsen AD lesions. Association between H. pylori and AD is suggested by 1) epidemiologic studies, which show higher AD prevalence and more pronounced cognitive impairment in infected than in noninfected subjects; 2) experimental studies in murine models: a) in a first study we evaluated the impact of H. pylori infection on the brain of non-AD predisposed C57BL/6J mice. After an 18-month infection, H. pylori induced a significant gastric inflammation but no brain Aβ deposit nor increased neuroinflammation was observed in their brain; b) we currently study the impact of Helicobacter species infection on behavior and cerebral lesions of AD transgenic (APPswe/PS1dE9) mice and their wild type littermate. The results of these studies do not allow to conclude a significant association between AD and H. pylory infection but may contribute to a better understanding of the role of brain neuroinflammation in AD.\", 'Quantitative IR microscopy and spectromics open the way to 3D digital pathology. Currently, only mass-spectrometry (MS) microscopy brings a quantitative analysis of chemical contents of tissue samples in 3D. Here, the reconstruction of a 3D quantitative chemical images of a biological tissue by FTIR spectro-microscopy is reported. An automated curve-fitting method is developed to extract all intense absorption bands constituting IR spectra. This innovation benefits from three critical features: (1) the correction of raw IR spectra to make them quantitatively comparable; (2) the automated and iterative data treatment allowing to transfer the IR-absorption spectrum into a IR-band spectrum; (3) the reconstruction of an 3D IR-band matrix (x, y, z for voxel position and a 4th dimension with all IR-band parameters). Spectromics, which is a new method for exploiting spectral data for tissue metadata reconstruction, is proposed to further translate the related chemical information in 3D, as biochemical and anatomical tissue parameters. An example is given with oxidative stress distribution and the reconstruction of blood vessels in tissues. The requirements of IR microscopy instrumentation to propose 3D digital histology as a clinical routine technology is briefly discussed. (Figure presented.).', 'Functional Analysis of Mitochondrial CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors (mtCB1) in the Brain. Recent evidence indicates that, besides its canonical localization at cell plasma membranes, the type-1 cannabinoid receptor, CB1 is functionally present at brain and muscle mitochondrial membranes (mtCB1). Through mtCB1 receptors, cannabinoids can directly regulate intramitochondrial signaling and respiration. This new and surprising discovery paves the way to new potential fields of research, dealing with the direct impact of G protein-coupled receptors on bioenergetic processes and its functional implications. In this chapter, we summarize some key experimental approaches established in our laboratories to identify anatomical, biochemical, and functional features of mtCB1 receptors in the brain. In particular, we describe the procedures to obtain reliable and controlled detection of mtCB1 receptors by immunogold electromicroscopy and by immunoblotting methods. Then, we address the study of direct cannabinoid effects on the electron transport system and oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, we present a functional example of the impact of mtCB1 receptors on mitochondrial mobility in cultured neurons. Considering the youth of the field, these methodological approaches will very likely be improved and refined in the future, but this chapter aims at presenting the methods that are currently used and, in particular, at underlining the need of rigorous controls to obtain reliable results. We hope that this chapter might help scientists becoming interested in this new and exciting field of research.', 'Temperature and metal exposure affect membrane fatty acid composition and transcription of desaturases and elongases in fathead minnow muscle and brain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that metal exposure affected the normal thermal response of cell membrane FA composition and of elongase and desaturase gene transcription levels. To this end, muscle and brain membrane FA composition and FA desaturase (fads2, degs2 and scd2) and elongase (elovl2, elovl5 and elovl6) gene transcription levels were analyzed in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) acclimated for eight weeks to 15, 25 or 30 °C exposed or not to cadmium (Cd, 6 μg/l) or nickel (Ni, 450 6 μg/l). The response of membrane FA composition to temperature variations or metal exposure differed between muscle and brain. In muscle, an increase of temperature induced a decrease of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and an increase of saturated FA (SFA) in agreement with the current paradigm. Although a similar response was observed in brain between 15 and 25 °C, at 30 °C, brain membrane unsaturation was higher than predicted. In both tissues, metal exposure affected the normal thermal response of membrane FA composition. The transcription of desaturases and elongases was higher in the brain and varied with acclimation temperature and metal exposure but these variations did not generally reflect changes in membrane FA composition. The mismatch between gene transcription and membrane composition highlights that several levels of control other than gene transcription are involved in adjusting membrane FA composition, including post-transcriptional regulation of elongases and desaturases and de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. Our study also reveals that metal exposure affects the mechanisms involved in adjusting cell membrane FA composition in ectotherms.', 'Molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas: Does location matter?. Glioblastomas in adults are highly heterogeneous tumors that can develop throughout the brain. To date no predictive-location marker has been identified. We previously derived two glioblastoma cell lines from cortical and periventricular locations and demonstrated distinct transcriptomic profiles. Based on these preliminary results, the aim of this study was to correlate glioblastoma locations with the expression of ten selected genes (VEGFC, FLT4, MET, HGF, CHI3L1, PROM1, NOTCH1, DLL3, PDGFRA, BCAN). Fifty nine patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were retrospectively included. Tumors were classified into cortical and periventricular locations, which were subsequently segregated according to cerebral lobes involved: cortical fronto-parietal (C-FP), cortical temporal (C-T), periventricular fronto-parietal (PV-FP), periventricular temporal (PV-T), and periventricular occipital (PV-O). Gene expression levels were determined using RT-qPCR. Compared to cortical glioblastomas, periventricular glioblastomas were characterized by a higher expression of two mesenchymal genes, VEGFC (p = 0.001) and HGF (p = 0.001). Among cortical locations, gene expressions were homogeneous. In contrast, periventricular locations exhibited distinct expression profiles. PV-T tumors were associated with higher expression of two proneural and cancer stem cell genes, NOTCH1 (p = 0.028) and PROM1 (p = 0.033) while PV-FP tumors were characterized by high expression of a mesenchymal gene, CHI3L1 (p = 0.006). Protein expression of NOTCH1 was correlated with RNA expression levels. PV-O glioblastomas were associated with lower expression of VEGFC (p = 0.032) than other periventricular locations, whereas MET overexpression remained exceptional. These data suggest a differential gene expression profile according to initial glioblastoma location.', 'Recommendations for the use of electroencephalography and evoked potentials in comatose patients. Predicting the outcome of a comatose or poorly responsive patient is a major issue for intensive care unit teams, in order to give the most accurate information to the family and to choose the best therapeutic option. However, determining the level of cortical activity in patients with disorders of consciousness is a real challenge. Reliable criteria are required to help clinicians in the decision-making process, especially in the acute phase of coma. In this paper, we propose recommendations for recording and interpreting electroencephalography and evoked potentials in comatose patients based on the literature and the clinical experience of a group of neurophysiologists trained in the management of comatose patients. We propose methodological guidelines and discuss prognostic value of each test as well as the limitations concerning recording and interpretation. Recommendations for the strategy and timing of neurophysiological assessments are also proposed according to various clinical situations.', \"Different tau species lead to heterogeneous tau pathology propagation and misfolding. Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by tau aggregation inside neurons. Most of them are sporadic but certain tauopathies rely on tau gene (MAPT) mutations. They particularly differ from one to another by their different neuropathological signatures e.g. lesion shapes, regions affected and molecular composition of aggregates. Six isoforms of tau exist, but they do not all co-aggregate in each tauopathy but rather have a unique signature for each one. In some tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau protein aggregation follows stereotypical anatomical stages. Recent data suggest that this progression is due to an active process of tau protein propagation from neuron-to-neuron. We wondered how tau isoforms or mutations could influence the process of tau aggregation and tau propagation. In human neuropathological material, we found that MAPT mutations induce a faster misfolding compared to tau found in sporadic AD patients. In the rat brain, we observed cell-to-cell transfer of non-pathological tau species irrespective of the tested isoform or presence of a mutation. By contrast, we found that the species of tau impact the propagation of tau pathology markers such as hyperphosphorylation and misfolding. Indeed, misfolding and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins do not spread at the same rate when tau is mutated, or the isoform composition is modified. These results clearly argue for the existence of specific folding properties of tau depending on isoforms or mutations impacting the behavior of pathological tau species.\", 'Surfaceome Proteomic of Glioblastoma Revealed Potential Targets for Immunotherapy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating malignant brain tumor in adults. The mortality rate is very high despite different treatments. New therapeutic targets are therefore highly needed. Cell-surface proteins represent attractive targets due to their accessibility, their involvement in essential signaling pathways, and their dysregulated expression in cancer. Moreover, they are potential targets for CAR-based immunotherapy or mRNA vaccine strategies. In this context, we investigated the GBM-associated surfaceome by comparing it to astrocytes cell line surfaceome to identify new specific targets for GBM. For this purpose, biotinylation of cell surface proteins has been carried out in GBM and astrocytes cell lines. Biotinylated proteins were purified on streptavidin beads and analyzed by shotgun proteomics. Cell surface proteins were identified with Cell Surface Proteins Atlas (CSPA) and Gene Ontology enrichment. Among all the surface proteins identified in the different cell lines we have confirmed the expression of 66 of these in patient’s glioblastoma using spatial proteomic guided by MALDI-mass spectrometry. Moreover, 87 surface proteins overexpressed or exclusive in GBM cell lines have been identified. Among these, we found 11 specific potential targets for GBM including 5 mutated proteins such as RELL1, CYBA, EGFR, and MHC I proteins. Matching with drugs and clinical trials databases revealed that 7 proteins were druggable and under evaluation, 3 proteins have no known drug interaction yet and none of them are the mutated form of the identified proteins. Taken together, we discovered potential targets for immune therapy strategies in GBM.', 'Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 inhibition rescues energy dysfunction and pathology in a model of tauopathy. Tau pathology is instrumental in the gradual loss of neuronal functions and cognitive decline in tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Earlier reports showed that adenosine metabolism is abnormal in the brain of AD patients while consequences remained ill-defined. Herein, we aimed at investigating whether manipulation of adenosine tone would impact Tau pathology, associated molecular alterations and subsequent neurodegeneration. We demonstrated that treatment with an inhibitor (J4) of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) exerted beneficial effects in a mouse model of Tauopathy. Treatment with J4 not only reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation but also rescued memory deficits, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic loss, and abnormal expression of immune-related gene signatures. These beneficial effects were particularly ascribed to the ability of J4 to suppress the overactivation of AMPK (an energy reduction sensor), suggesting that normalization of energy dysfunction mitigates neuronal dysfunctions in Tauopathy. Collectively, these data highlight that targeting adenosine metabolism is a novel strategy for tauopathies. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]', \"The compartmentalized inflammatory response in the multiple sclerosis brain is composed of tissue-resident CD8+ T lymphocytes and B cells. Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease in which active demyelination and neurodegeneration are associated with lymphocyte infiltrates in the brain. However, so far little is known regarding the phenotype and function of these infiltrating lymphocyte populations. In this study, we performed an in-depth phenotypic characterization of T and B cell infiltrates in a large set of multiple sclerosis cases with different disease and lesion stages and compared the findings with those seen in inflammatory, non-inflammatory and normal human controls. In multiple sclerosis lesions, we found a dominance of CD8+ T cells and a prominent contribution of CD20+ B cells in all disease courses and lesion stages, including acute multiple sclerosis cases with very short disease duration, while CD4+ T cells were sparse. A dominance of CD8+ T cells was also seen in other inflammatory controls, such as Rasmussen's encephalitis and viral encephalitis, but the contribution of B cells in these diseases was modest. Phenotypic analysis of the CD8+ T cells suggested that part of the infiltrating cells in active lesions proliferate, show an activated cytotoxic phenotype and are in part destroyed by apoptosis. Further characterization of the remaining cells suggest that CD8+ T cells acquire features of tissue-resident memory cells, which may be focally reactivated in active lesions of acute, relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis, while B cells, at least in part, gradually transform into plasma cells. The loss of surface molecules involved in the egress of leucocytes from inflamed tissue, such as S1P1 or CCR7, and the upregulation of CD103 expression may be responsible for the compartmentalization of the inflammatory response in established lesions. Similar phenotypic changes of tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were also seen in Rasmussen's encephalitis. Our data underline the potential importance of CD8+ T lymphocytes and B cells in the inflammatory response in established multiple sclerosis lesions. Tissue-resident T and B cells may represent guardians of previous inflammatory brain disease, which can be reactivated and sustain the inflammatory response, when they are re-exposed to their specific antigen.\", \"Brain activity induced by implicit processing of others' pain and pleasure. Studies indicate that both explicit and implicit processing of affectively charged stimuli may be reflected in specific behavioural markers and physiological signatures. Here, we investigated whether the pleasantness ratings of a neutral target were affected by the subliminal perception of a painful (a slap) or pleasant (a caress) touch delivered to others. In particular, we combined the continuous flash suppression technique with the affective misattribution procedure to explore subliminal processing of observed pain and pleasure in others. Results show that participants rated the neutral target as more or less likeable depending on whether they were subliminally primed with the pleasant or painful facial expression, respectively. The fMRI activity associated with painful and pleasant subliminal priming was mainly present in the anterior prefrontal cortex and the primary sensorimotor cortex, respectively. Thus, our study provides behavioural and neuro-physiological evidence that: (i) emotional reactivity toward positive or negative states of others can occur at an entirely subliminal level; (ii) specific neural substrates underpin reactivity to positive- and negative-valence of social emotions.

During bimanual coordination, that is, manipulating with the dominant hand an object held by the postural hand, anticipatory postural adjustments are required to cancel the perturbations and ensure postural stabilization. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we investigated changes mediating the acquisition of anticipatory postural adjustments during a bimanual load-lifting task. Participants lifted a load with their right hand, hence triggering the fall of a second load fixed to their left (postural) forearm. During Acquisition, the onset of load-lifting and the fall of the second load were experimentally delayed after few trials. During Control, load-lifting triggered the fall of the second load without delay. Upward elbow rotation decreased with trial repetition during Acquisition, hence attesting the ongoing acquisition of anticipatory postural adjustments. Bilateral event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz) was recorded. Generators of the mu rhythm were found within central and associative motor regions. Their spatial distribution within the hemisphere contralateral to the load-lifting arm was less refined and circumscribed during Acquisition compared to Control. Regression analyses emphasized the specific involvement of the precuneus in the right hemisphere contralateral to the postural forearm, and a medial prefrontal region in the left hemisphere. Analyses of the time course power showed that an increase in preunloading activation within the precuneus and a decrease in postunloading inhibition within the medial prefrontal region were associated with the acquisition of anticipatory postural adjustments. The study provides original insights into cortical activations mediating the progressive tuning of anticipatory postural adjustments during the acquisition stage of motor learning.', 'Impact of aerobic exercise, sex, and metabolic syndrome on markers of oxidative stress: Results from the Brain in Motion study. Impact of aerobic exercise, sex, and metabolic syndromeson markers of oxidative stress: results from the Brain in Motion study.sJ Appl Physiol 128: 748 756, 2020. First published February 27,s2020; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00667.2019. Oxidative stress maysbe involved in disease pathology and dependent on both modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. This study aimed to assess exerciseinduced changes in markers of oxidative stress among older, sedentary adults and to determine the effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) status, aerobic capacity, age, sex, and weight on these biomarkers. Two hundred and six participants (means ± SE; 66.8 ± 6.4 yr, 104 women) of the Brain in Motion study underwent a 6-mo aerobic exercise intervention. At three time points, venous blood samples were collected and analyzed for markers of oxidative stress [advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and antioxidant status: catalase, uric acid (UA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP)]. AOPP levels significantly decreased after 6 mo of aerobic exercise (P = 0.003). This decrease was not modified by MetS status (P = 0.183). Subjects with MetS possessed significantly higher levels of AOPP (P < 0.001), MDA (P = 0.004), and FRAP (P = 0.049) across the intervention (months 0 6). Men possessed significantly higher levels of FRAP (P < 0.001), catalase (P = 0.023), and UA (P = 0.037) across the intervention (months 0 6). Sex-MetS status interaction analyses revealed that the effect of MetS is highly sex dependent. These findings are multifaceted because the effect of MetS status seems distinctly different between sexes, pointing to the importance of acknowledging modifiable and nonmodifiable factor differences in individuals who possess conditions where oxidative stress may be part of the etiology.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Oxidative stress is implicated in a myriad of conditions, namely cardiovascular disease risk factors. This article details the effect of aerobic exercise, sex, and metabolic syndrome on markers of oxidative stress. We conclude that 6 mo of aerobic exercise significantly decreased oxidative stress, and further, that there is an effect of metabolic syndrome status on oxidative stress and antioxidant status levels, which are highly dependent on the sex of the individual.', 'Semiquantitative Scale for Assessing Brain MRI Abnormalities in Wilson Disease: A Validation Study. Background: MRI is a sensitive method for the assessment of brain abnormalities in Wilson disease, that is, T2 hyperintensities, T2 hypointensities, and atrophy, but a validated scoring system for the classification of radiological severity is lacking. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a brain MRI visual rating scale for Wilson disease. Methods: The proposed Wilson disease brain MRI severity scale consists of acute toxicity and chronic damage subscores from predefined structures. The former, calculated by summing scores of T2 hyperintensities (excluding cavitation), is likely to be partially reversible with treatment. The latter, representing the sum of scores of T2 hypointensities and brain atrophy, reflects pathology that is not readily reversible. Validation was performed on MRI scans acquired using 1.5T system from 39 Wilson disease patients examined at baseline and after 24 months on anticopper treatment. Intraclass correlation coefficients of 5 ratings from 3 raters were calculated. Temporal evolution of the MRI severity score and its association with clinical severity, assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale part III, was calculated. Results: Intrarater and interrater agreement were good (r > 0.93; P < 0.001; and r > 0.74; P < 0.001, respectively). In neurologic Wilson disease patients, the total MRI severity score improved over 2 years (P = 0.032), mainly because of reduced acute toxicity (P = 0.0015), whereas the chronic damage score deteriorated (P = 0.035). Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale part III score was positively associated with chronic damage and total score at baseline (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively) and in month 24 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The Wilson disease brain MRI severity scale is a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that allows semiquantitative assessment of radiological Wilson disease severity. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.', 'Stereoscopic three-dimensional visualization: interest for neuroanatomy teaching in medical school. Purpose: The anatomy of both the brain and the skull is particularly difficult to learn and to teach. Since their anatomical structures are numerous and gathered in a complex tridimensional (3D) architecture, classic schematical drawing or photography in two dimensions (2D) has difficulties in providing a clear, simple, and accurate message. Advances in photography and computer sciences have led to develop stereoscopic 3D visualization, firstly for entertainment then for education. In the present study, we report our experience of stereoscopic 3D lecture for neuroanatomy teaching to early medical school students. Methods: High-resolution specific pictures were taken on various specimen dissections in the Anatomy Laboratory of the University of Lyon, France. Selected stereoscopic 3D views were displayed on a large dedicated screen using a doubled video projector. A 2-h stereoscopic neuroanatomy lecture was given by two neuroanatomists to third-year medicine students who wore passive 3D glasses. Setting up lasted 30\\xa0min and involved four people. The feedback from students was collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 483 students who have attended the stereoscopic 3D lecture, 195 gave feedback, and all (100%) were satisfied. Among these, 190 (97.5%) reported a better knowledge transfer of brain anatomy and its 3D architecture. Furthermore, 167 (86.1%) students felt it could change their further clinical practice, 179 (91.8%) thought it could enhance their results in forthcoming anatomy examinations, and 150 (76.9%) believed such a 3D lecture might allow them to become better physicians. This 3D anatomy lecture was graded 8.9/10 a mean against 5.9/10 for previous classical 2D lectures. Discussion–conclusion: The stereoscopic 3D teaching of neuroanatomy made medical students enthusiastic involving digital technologies. It could improve their anatomical knowledge and test scores, as well as their clinical competences. Depending on university means and the commitment of teachers, this new tool should be extended to other anatomical fields. However, its setting up requires resources from faculties and its impact on clinical competencies needs to be objectively assessed.', 'Sleep problems in Rett syndrome animal models: A systematic review. Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and Drosophila. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24-hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non-rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.', 'Synapse biology in the ‘circuit-age’—paths toward molecular connectomics. The neural connectome is a critical determinant of brain function. Circuits of precisely wired neurons, and the features of transmission at the synapses connecting them, are thought to dictate information processing in the brain. While recent technological advances now allow to define the anatomical and functional neural connectome at unprecedented resolution, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that establish the precise patterns of connectivity and the functional characteristics of synapses has remained challenging. Here, we describe the power and limitations of genetic approaches in the analysis of mechanisms that control synaptic connectivity and function, and discuss how recent methodological developments in proteomics might be used to elucidate the molecular synaptic connectome that is at the basis of the neural connectome.', \"Validation of the movement disorder society criteria for the diagnosis of 4-repeat tauopathies. Background: The Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy introduced the category “probable 4-repeat (4R)-tauopathy” for joint clinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Objectives: To validate the accuracy of these clinical criteria for “probable 4R-tauopathy” to predict underlying 4R-tauopathy pathology. Methods: Diagnostic accuracy for 4R-tauopathies according to the established criteria was estimated retrospectively in autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration (grouped as 4R-tauopathies), and Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (grouped as non-4R-tauopathies). Results: We identified 250 cases with progressive supranuclear palsy (N = 195) and corticobasal degeneration (N = 55) and with and non-4R-tauopathies (N = 161). Sensitivity and specificity of “probable 4R-tauopathy” was 10% and 99% in the first year and 59% and 88% at final record. Conclusions: The new diagnostic category “probable 4R-tauopathy” showed high specificity and may be suitable for the recruitment of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration into therapeutic trials targeting 4R-tauopathy. The low sensitivity underpins the need for diagnostic biomarkers. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\", 'Simulated microgravity subtlety changes monoamine function across the rat brain. Microgravity, one of the conditions faced by astronauts during spaceflights, triggers brain adaptive responses that could have noxious consequences on behaviors. Although monoaminergic systems, which include noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), are widespread neuromodulatory systems involved in adaptive behaviors, the influence of microgravity on these systems is poorly documented. Using a model of simulated microgravity (SMG) during a short period in Long Evans male rats, we studied the distribution of monoamines in thirty brain regions belonging to vegetative, mood, motor, and cognitive networks. SMG modified NA and/or DA tissue contents along some brain regions belonging to the vestibular/motor systems (inferior olive, red nucleus, cerebellum, somatosensorily cortex, substantia nigra, and shell of the nucleus accumbens). DA and 5-HT contents were reduced in the prelimbic cortex, the only brain area exhibiting changes for 5-HT content. However, the number of correlations of one index of the 5-HT metabolism (ratio of metabolite and 5-HT) alone or in interaction with the DA metabolism was dramatically increased between brain regions. It is suggested that SMG, by mobilizing vestibular/motor systems, promotes in these systems early, restricted changes of NA and DA functions that are associated with a high reorganization of monoaminergic systems, notably 5-HT.', 'Association of chronic inflammation and perceived stress with abnormal functional connectivity in brain areas involved with interoception in hepatitis C patients. Background: Sickness behavioral changes elicited by inflammation may become prolonged and dysfunctional in patients with chronic disease, such as chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Neuroimaging studies show that the basal ganglia and insula are sensitive to systemic inflammation. Aim: To elucidate the clinical and neurobiological aspects of prolonged illnesses in patients with CHC. Methods: Thirty-five CHC patients not treated with interferon-α or other antiviral therapy, and 30 control subjects matched for age and sex, were evaluated for perceived stress (perceived stress scale; PSS), depression (PHQ-9), fatigue and irritability through a visual analog scale (VAS), as well as serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and oxidative stress markers. Functional MRI was performed, measuring resting-state functional connectivity using a region-of-interest (seed)-based approach focusing on the bilateral insula, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral putamen. Between-group differences in functional connectivity patterns were assessed with two-sample t-tests, while the associations between symptoms, inflammatory markers and functional connectivity patterns were analyzed with multiple regression analyses. Results: CHC patients had higher PSS, PHQ-9 and VAS scores for fatigue and irritability, as well as increased IL-6 levels, PGE2 concentrations and antioxidant system activation compared to controls. PSS scores positively correlated with functional connectivity between the right anterior insula and right putamen, whereas PHQ-9 scores correlated with functional connectivity between most of the seeds and the right anterior insula. PGE2 (positively) and IL-6 (negatively) correlated with functional connectivity between the right anterior insula and right caudate nucleus and between the right ventral putamen and right putamen/globus pallidus. PGE2 and PSS scores accounted for 46% of the variance in functional connectivity between the anterior insula and putamen. Conclusions: CHC patients exhibited increased perceived stress and depressive symptoms, which were associated with changes in inflammatory marker levels and in functional connectivity between the insula and putamen, areas involved in interoceptive integration, emotional awareness, and orientation of motivational state.', 'Multi-hit early life adversity affects gut microbiota, brain and behavior in a sex-dependent manner. The accumulation of adverse events in utero and during childhood differentially increases the vulnerability to psychiatric diseases in men and women. Gut microbiota is highly sensitive to the early environment and has been recently hypothesized to affect brain development. However, the impact of early-life adversity on gut microbiota, notably with regards to sex differences, remains to be explored. We examined the effects of multifactorial early-life adversity on behavior and microbiota composition in C3H/HeN mice of both sexes exposed to a combination of maternal immune activation (lipopolysaccharide injection on embryonic day 17, 120 µg/kg, i.p.), maternal separation (3hr per day from postnatal day (PND)2 to PND14) and maternal unpredictable chronic mild stress. At adulthood, offspring exposed to multi-hit early adversity showed sex-specific behavioral phenotypes with males exhibiting deficits in social behavior and females showing increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze and increased compulsive behavior in the marble burying test. Early adversity also differentially regulated gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) according to sex. Interestingly, several genes such as Arc, Btg2, Fosb, Egr4 or Klf2 were oppositely regulated by early adversity in males versus females. Finally, 16S-based microbiota profiling revealed sex-dependent gut dysbiosis. In males, abundance of taxa belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Porphyromonadaceae families or other unclassified Firmicutes, but also Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Alloprevotella genera was regulated by early adversity. In females, the effects of early adversity were limited and mainly restricted to Lactobacillus and Mucispirillum genera. Our work reveals marked sex differences in a multifactorial model of early-life adversity, both on emotional behaviors and gut microbiota, suggesting that sex should systematically be considered in preclinical studies both in neurogastroenterology and psychiatric research.', 'EGFRvIII mutations can emerge as late and heterogenous events in glioblastoma development and promote angiogenesis through Src activation. Background. Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutant EGFRvIII are among the most common genetic alterations in glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Methods. In the present work, we analyzed the clonal evolution of these major EGFR aberrations in a small cohort of GBM patients using a unique surgical multisampling technique. Furthermore, we overexpressed both receptors separately and together in 2 patient-derived GBM stem cell lines (GSCs) to analyze their functions in vivo in orthotopic xenograft models. Results. In human GBM biopsies, we identified EGFR amplification as an early event because EGFRvIII mutations emerge from intratumoral heterogeneity later in tumor development. To investigate the biological relevance of this distinct developmental pattern, we established experimental model systems. In these models, EGFR+ tumor cells showed activation of classical downstream signaling pathways upon EGF stimulation and displayed enhanced invasive growth without evidence of angiogenesis in vivo. In contrast, EGFRvIII+ tumors were driven by activation of the prototypical Src family kinase c-Src that promoted VEGF secretion leading to angiogenic tumor growth. Conclusions. The presented work shows that sequential EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII mutations might represent concerted evolutionary events that drive the aggressive nature of GBM by promoting invasion and angiogenesis via distinct signaling pathways. In particular, c-SRC may be an attractive therapeutic target for tumors harboring EGFRvIII as we identified this protein specifically mediating angiogenic tumor growth downstream of EGFRvIII.', 'Interest of robotic stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of brain metastases: Results of a retrospective, single center analysis. Purpose: The management of malignant brain metastases becomes a main issue for the treatment of patients, because of the survival extension related to the improvement in systemic treatments. Robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (RSR) is a new approach in this indication. The purpose of this analysis was to define the efficacy of RSR, in order to determine prognostic factors of survival and factors of response. Patients and methods: It was a retrospective, single center (polyclinique de Bordeaux Nord Aquitaine) analysis performed from 2012 to 2015, involving patients with malignant brain metastases treated by RSR using the Cyberknife® technique. We analyzed the following parameters: response to RSR, prognostic and predictive factors of response, and survival. Results: A total of 72 RSRs were performed among 55 analyzed patients; 62 treatments were assessable with a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The main delivered dose on the 80%-isodose was 20 Gy. A complete response was achieved in 40.3% of patients (stability or regression = 83.9%). The overall survival was 13 months. The risk of failure was significantly correlated with the increase in metastasis size and non-adenocarcinoma histology. A performance status < 2 was the main prognostic factor of survival. Conclusions: The RSR allowed treating 3 to 5 brain metastases, avoiding an entire brain irradiation, and maintaining survival and quality of life.', \"Sulcal pattern variation in extant human endocasts. Our knowledge of human brain evolution primarily relies on the interpretation of palaeoneurological evidence. In this context, an endocast or replica of the inside of the bony braincase can be used to reconstruct a timeline of cerebral changes that occurred during human evolution, including changes in topographic extension and structural organisation of cortical areas. These changes can be tracked by identifying cerebral imprints, particularly cortical sulci. The description of these crucial landmarks in fossil endocasts is, however, challenging. High-resolution imaging techniques in palaeoneurology offer new opportunities for tracking detailed endocranial neural characteristics. In this study, we use high-resolution imaging techniques to document the variation in extant human endocranial sulcal patterns for subsequent use as a platform for comparison with the fossil record. We selected 20 extant human crania from the Pretoria Bone Collection (University of Pretoria, South Africa), which were detailed using X-ray microtomography at a spatial resolution ranging from 94 to 123\\xa0μm (isometric). We used Endex to extract, and Matlab to analyse the cortical imprints on the endocasts. We consistently identified superior, middle and inferior sulci on the frontal lobe; and superior and inferior sulci on the temporal lobe. We were able to label sulci bordering critical functional areas such as Broca's cap. Mapping the sulcal patterns on extant endocasts is a prerequisite for constructing an atlas which can be used for automatic sulci recognition.\", \"Variability in Brain Structure and Function Reflects Lack of Peer Support. Humans are a highly social species. Complex interactions for mutual support range from helping neighbors to building social welfare institutions. During times of distress or crisis, sharing life experiences within one's social circle is critical for well-being. By translating pattern-learning algorithms to the UK Biobank imaging-genetics cohort (n = ~40 000 participants), we have delineated manifestations of regular social support in multimodal whole-brain measurements. In structural brain variation, we identified characteristic volumetric signatures in the salience and limbic networks for high- versus low-social support individuals. In patterns derived from functional coupling, we also located interindividual differences in social support in action-perception circuits related to binding sensory cues and initiating behavioral responses. In line with our demographic profiling analysis, the uncovered neural substrates have potential implications for loneliness, substance misuse, and resilience to stress.\", 'Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the main cause of female infertility worldwide and corresponds with a high degree of comorbidities and economic burden. How PCOS is passed on from one generation to the next is not clear, but it may be a developmental condition. Most women with PCOS exhibit higher levels of circulating luteinizing hormone, suggestive of heightened gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as compared to healthy women. Excess AMH in utero may affect the development of the female fetus. However, as AMH levels drop during pregnancy in women with normal fertility, it was unclear whether their levels were also elevated in pregnant women with PCOS. Here we measured AMH in a cohort of pregnant women with PCOS and control pregnant women and found that AMH is significantly more elevated in the former group versus the latter. To determine whether the elevation of AMH during pregnancy in women with PCOS is a bystander effect or a driver of the condition in the offspring, we modeled our clinical findings by treating pregnant mice with AMH and followed the neuroendocrine phenotype of their female progeny postnatally. This treatment resulted in maternal neuroendocrine-driven testosterone excess and diminished placental metabolism of testosterone to estradiol, resulting in a masculinization of the exposed female fetus and a PCOS-like reproductive and neuroendocrine phenotype in adulthood. We found that the affected females had persistently hyperactivated GnRH neurons and that GnRH antagonist treatment in the adult female offspring restored their neuroendocrine phenotype to a normal state. These findings highlight a critical role for excess prenatal AMH exposure and subsequent aberrant GnRH receptor signaling in the neuroendocrine dysfunctions of PCOS, while offering a new potential therapeutic avenue to treat the condition during adulthood.', 'Effects of Methylphenidate on Default-Mode Network/Task-Positive Network Synchronization in Children With ADHD. Objective: A failure of the anti-phase synchronization between default-mode (DMN) and task-positive networks (TPN) may be involved in a main manifestation of ADHD: moment-to-moment variability. The study investigated whereby methylphenidate may improve TPN/DMN synchronization in ADHD. Method: Eleven drug-naive ADHD children and 11 typically developing (TD) children performed a flanker task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The ADHD group was scanned without and 1 month later with methylphenidate. The signal was analyzed by independent component analysis. Results: The TD group showed anti-phase DMN/TPN synchronization. The unmedicated ADHD group showed synchronous activity in the posterior DMN only, which was positively correlated with response time variability for the flanker task. Methylphenidate initiated a partial anti-phase TPN/DMN synchronization, reduced variability, and abolished the variability/DMN correlation. Conclusion: Although results should be interpreted cautiously because the sample size is small, they suggest that a failure of the TPN/DMN synchronization could be involved in the moment-to-moment variability in ADHD. Methylphenidate initiated TPN/DMN synchronization, which in turn appeared to reduce variability.', 'Spread the word: MMN brain response reveals whole-form access of discontinuous particle verbs. The status of particle verbs such as rise (…) up as either lexically stored or combinatorially assembled is an issue which so far has not been settled decisively. In this study, we use the mismatch negativity (MMN) brain response to observe neurophysiological responses to discontinuous particle verbs. The MMN can be used to distinguish between whole-form storage and combinatorial processes, as it is enhanced to stored words compared to unknown pseudowords, whereas combinatorially legal strings elicit a reduced MMN relative to ungrammatical ones. Earlier work had found larger MMNs to congruent than to incongruent verb-particle combinations when particle and verb appeared as adjacent elements, thus suggesting whole-form storage at least in this case. However, it is still possible that particle verbs discontinuously spread out across a sentence would elicit the combinatorial, grammar-violation response pattern instead. Here, we tested the brain signatures of discontinuous verb-particle combinations, orthogonally varying congruence and semantic transparency. The results show for the first time brain indices of whole-form storage for discontinuous constituents, thus arguing in favour of access to whole-form-stored lexical elements in the processing of particle verbs, irrespective of their semantic opacity. Results are discussed in the context of linguistic debates about the status of particle verbs as words, lexical elements or syntactically generated combinations. The explanation of the pattern of results within a neurobiological language model is highlighted.', 'Camkiiβ in neuronal development and plasticity: An emerging candidate in brain diseases. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a ubiquitous and central player in Ca2+ signaling that is best known for its functions in the brain. In particular, the α isoform of CaMKII has been the subject of intense research and it has been established as a central regulator of neuronal plasticity. In contrast, little attention has been paid to CaMKIIβ, the other predominant brain isoform that interacts directly with the actin cytoskeleton, and the functions of CaMKIIβ in this organ remain largely unexplored. However, recently, the perturbation of CaMKIIβ expression has been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases, highlighting CAMK2B as a gene of interest. Herein, after highlighting the main structural and expression differences between the α and β isoforms, we will review the specific functions of CaMKIIβ, as described so far, in neuronal development and plasticity,as well as its potential implication in brain diseases.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers of exercise-induced improvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain of old high-fat-fed ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Key points: Vascular brain lesions and atherosclerosis are two similar conditions that are characterized by increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Non-invasive imaging in a murine model of atherosclerosis showed vascular brain damage and peripheral inflammation. In this study, exercise training reduced magnetic resonance imaging-detected abnormalities, insulin resistance and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in old ApoE−/− mice. Our results demonstrate the protective effect of exercise on neurovascular damage in the ageing brain of ApoE−/− mice. Abstract: Vascular brain lesions, present in advanced atherosclerosis, share pathological hallmarks with peripheral vascular lesions, such as increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Physical activity reduces these peripheral risk factors, but its cerebrovascular effect is less documented, especially by non-invasive imaging. Through a combination of in vivo and post-mortem techniques, we aimed to characterize vascular brain damage in old ApoE−/− mice fed a high-cholesterol (HC) diet with dietary controlled intake. We then sought to determine the beneficial effects of exercise training on oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain as a treatment option in an ageing atherosclerosis mouse model. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biological markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, we evaluated the occurrence of vascular abnormalities in the brain of HC-diet fed ApoE−/− mice >70 weeks old, its association with local and systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, and whether both can be modulated by exercise. Exercise training significantly reduced both MRI-detected abnormalities (present in 71% of untrained vs. 14% of trained mice) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, 9.1\\xa0±\\xa01.4 vs. 5.2\\xa0±\\xa00.9\\xa0μmol\\xa0mg−1; P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and inflammation (interleukin-1β, 226.8\\xa0±\\xa027.1 vs. 182.5\\xa0±\\xa021.5\\xa0pg\\xa0mg−1; P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the brain, and the mortality rate. Exercise also decreased peripheral insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflammation, but significant associations were seen only within brain markers. Highly localized vascular brain damage is a frequent finding in this ageing atherosclerosis model, and exercise is able to reduce this outcome and improve lifespan. In vivo MRI evaluated both the neurovascular damage and the protective effect of exercise.', 'Neural correlates of verbal working memory in children with epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes. Background: Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified brain systems underlying different components of working memory (WM) in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the functional integrity of these neural networks in children with self-limited childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (ECTS) as compared to healthy controls, using a verbal working memory task (WMT). Methods: Functional MRI of WM in seventeen 6-to-13 year-old children, diagnosed with ECTS, and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were conducted at 3 T. To estimate BOLD responses during the maintenance of low, medium, and high WMT loads, we used a Sternberg verbal WMT. Neuropsychological testing prior to scanning and behavioral data during scanning were also acquired. Results: Behavioral performances during WMT, in particular accuracy and response time, were poorer in children with ECTS than in controls. Increased WM load was associated with increased BOLD signal in all subjects, with significant clusters detected in frontal and parietal regions, predominantly in the left hemisphere. However, under the high load condition, patients showed reduced activation in the frontal, temporal and parietal regions as compared to controls. In brain regions where WM-triggered BOLD activation differed between groups, this activation correlated with neuropsychological performances in healthy controls but not in patients with ECTS, further suggesting WM network dysfunction in the latter. Conclusion: Children with ECTS differ from healthy controls in how they control WM processes during tasks with increasing difficulty level, notably for high WM load where patients demonstrate both reduced BOLD activation and behavioral performances.', 'Neural dynamics of grip and goal integration during the processing of others’ actions with objects: An ERP study. Recent behavioural evidence suggests that when processing others’ actions, motor acts and goal-related information both contribute to action recognition. Yet the neuronal mechanisms underlying the dynamic integration of the two action dimensions remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the ERP components underlying the processing and integration of grip and goal-related information. The electrophysiological activity of 28 adults was recorded during the processing of object-directed action photographs (e.g., writing with pencil) containing either grip violations (e.g. upright pencil grasped with atypical-grip), goal violations (e.g., upside-down pencil grasped with typical-grip), both grip and goal violations (e.g., upside-down pencil grasped with atypical-grip), or no violations. Participants judged whether actions were overall typical or not according to object typical use. Brain activity was sensitive to the congruency between grip and goal information on the N400, reflecting the semantic integration between the two dimensions. On earlier components, brain activity was affected by grip and goal typicality independently. Critically, goal typicality but not grip typicality affected brain activity on the N300, supporting an earlier role of goal-related representations in action recognition. Findings provide new insights on the neural temporal dynamics of the integration of motor acts and goal-related information during the processing of others’ actions.', 'Transcriptomic signatures of brain regional vulnerability to Parkinson’s disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying caudal-to-rostral progression of Lewy body pathology in Parkinson’s disease remain poorly understood. Here, we identified transcriptomic signatures across brain regions involved in Braak Lewy body stages in non-neurological adults from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Among the genes that are indicative of regional vulnerability, we found known genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease: SCARB2, ELOVL7, SH3GL2, SNCA, BAP1, and ZNF184. Results were confirmed in two datasets of non-neurological subjects, while in two datasets of Parkinson’s disease patients we found altered expression patterns. Co-expression analysis across vulnerable regions identified a module enriched for genes associated with dopamine synthesis and microglia, and another module related to the immune system, blood-oxygen transport, and endothelial cells. Both were highly expressed in regions involved in the preclinical stages of the disease. Finally, alterations in genes underlying these region-specific functions may contribute to the selective regional vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease brains.', 'GlcNAc6ST3 is a keratan sulfate sulfotransferase for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ in the adult brain. Keratan sulfate (KS) is a carbohydrate side chain covalently attached to extracellular proteoglycans. KS is composed of disaccharide units of 6-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and galactose. We have previously shown that GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase (GlcNAc6ST) 1 encoded by Chst2 is an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of GlcNAc-6-sulfated KS chains that are required for neuronal plasticity in the visual cortex of the mouse brain during the critical period, but not in adulthood. Here, we show that GlcNAc-6-sulfated KS recognized by the R-10G anti-KS antibody, of which the minimum epitope structure is Galß1-4GlcNAc(6S)ß1-3Galß1-4GlcNAc(6S), distributes diffusely in neuropils and presents densely in close proximity to the perineuronal region of the perineuronal net (PNN)-positive neurons in the adult visual cortex. Surprisingly, GlcNAc6ST3, which was discovered as an intestinal GlcNAc6ST encoded by Chst5, is a major brain KS sulfotransferase expressed in oligodendrocytes in adulthood. Moreover, we identified an isoform of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ as a R-10G-reactive KS proteoglycan. These results indicate that GlcNAc6ST3 may play a role in synthesis of a component of PNN in the adult brain, and that the KS-modified isoform of PTPRZ encoded by Ptprz1 could be an extracellular molecule associated with PNNs.', 'Characterization of immune cell-derived extracellular vesicles and studying functional impact on cell environment. The neuroinflammatory state of the central nervous system (CNS) plays a key role in physiological and pathological conditions. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, and sometimes the infiltrating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), regulate the inflammatory profile of their microenvironment in the CNS. It is now accepted that the extracellular vesicle (EV) populations from immune cells act as immune mediators. Thus, their collection and isolation are important to identify their contents but also evaluate their biological effects on recipient cells. The present data highlight chronological requirements for EV isolation from microglia cells or blood macrophages including the ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) steps. A non-targeted proteomic analysis permitted the validation of protein signatures as EV markers and characterized the biologically active EV contents. Microglia-derived EVs were also functionally used on primary culture of neurons to assess their importance as immune mediators in the neurite outgrowth. The results showed that microglia-derived EVs contribute to facilitate the neurite outgrowth in vitro. In parallel, blood macrophage-derived EVs were functionally used as immune mediators in spheroid cultures of C6 glioma cells, the results showing that these EVs control the glioma cell invasion in vitro. This report highlights the possibility to evaluate the EV-mediated immune cell functions but also understand the molecular bases of such a communication. This deciphering could promote the use of natural vesicles and/or the in vitro preparation of therapeutic vesicles in order to mimic immune properties in the microenvironment of CNS pathologies.', \"How specialized are writing-specific brain regions? An fMRI study of writing, drawing and oral spelling. Several brain imaging studies identified brain regions that are consistently involved in writing tasks; the left premotor and superior parietal cortices have been associated with the peripheral components of writing performance as opposed to other regions that support the central, orthographic components. Based on a meta-analysis by Planton, Jucla, Roux, and Demonet (2013), we focused on five such writing areas and questioned the task-specificity and hemispheric lateralization profile of the brain response in an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment where 16 right-handed participants wrote down, spelled out orally object names, and drew shapes from object pictures. All writing-related areas were activated by drawing, and some of them by oral spelling, thus questioning their specialization for written production. The graphemic/motor frontal area (GMFA), a subpart of the superior premotor cortex close to Exner's area (Roux et\\xa0al., 2009), was the only area with a writing-specific lateralization profile, that is, clear left lateralization during handwriting, and bilateral activity during drawing. Furthermore, the relative lateralization and levels of activation in the superior parietal cortex, ventral premotor cortex, ventral occipitotemporal cortex and right cerebellum across the three tasks brought out new evidence regarding their respective contributions to the writing processes.\", \"Neural mechanisms of insect navigation. We know more about the ethology of insect navigation than the neural substrates. Few studies have shown direct effects of brain manipulation on navigational behaviour; or measure brain responses that clearly relate to the animal's current location or spatial target, independently of specific sensory cues. This is partly due to the methodological problems of obtaining neural data in a naturally behaving animal. However, substantial indirect evidence, such as comparative anatomy and knowledge of the neural circuits that provide relevant sensory inputs provide converging arguments for the role of some specific brain areas: The mushroom bodies; and the central complex. Finally, modelling can help bridge the gap by relating the computational requirements of a given navigational task to the type of computation offered by different brain areas.\", 'Dual Molecular Effects of Dominant RORA Mutations Cause Two Variants of Syndromic Intellectual Disability with Either Autism or Cerebellar Ataxia. RORα, the RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, is essential for cerebellar development. The spontaneous mutant mouse staggerer, with an ataxic gait caused by neurodegeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, was discovered two decades ago to result from homozygous intragenic Rora deletions. However, RORA mutations were hitherto undocumented in humans. Through a multi-centric collaboration, we identified three copy-number variant deletions (two de novo and one dominantly inherited in three generations), one de novo disrupting duplication, and nine de novo point mutations (three truncating, one canonical splice site, and five missense mutations) involving RORA in 16 individuals from 13 families with variable neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability (ID)-associated autistic features, cerebellar ataxia, and epilepsy. Consistent with the human and mouse data, disruption of the D. rerio ortholog, roraa, causes significant reduction in the size of the developing cerebellum. Systematic in vivo complementation studies showed that, whereas wild-type human RORA mRNA could complement the cerebellar pathology, missense variants had two distinct pathogenic mechanisms of either haploinsufficiency or a dominant toxic effect according to their localization in the ligand-binding or DNA-binding domains, respectively. This dichotomous direction of effect is likely relevant to the phenotype in humans: individuals with loss-of-function variants leading to haploinsufficiency show ID with autistic features, while individuals with de novo dominant toxic variants present with ID, ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy. Our combined genetic and functional data highlight the complex mutational landscape at the human RORA locus and suggest that dual mutational effects likely determine phenotypic outcome.', \"Loss of Tau protein affects the structure, transcription and repair of neuronal pericentromeric heterochromatin. Pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) gives rise to highly dense chromatin sub-structures rich in the epigenetic mark corresponding to the trimethylated form of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) and in heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), which regulate genome expression and stability. We demonstrate that Tau, a protein involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), binds to and localizes within or next to neuronal PCH in primary neuronal cultures from wild-type mice. Concomitantly, we show that the clustered distribution of H3K9me3 and HP1α, two hallmarks of PCH, is disrupted in neurons from Tau-deficient mice (KOTau). Such altered distribution of H3K9me3 that could be rescued by overexpressing nuclear Tau protein was also observed in neurons from AD brains. Moreover, the expression of PCH non-coding RNAs, involved in PCH organization, was disrupted in KOTau neurons that displayed an abnormal accumulation of stress-induced PCH DNA breaks. Altogether, our results demonstrate a new physiological function of Tau in directly regulating neuronal PCH integrity that appears disrupted in AD neurons.\", 'Neuroprotective role of lactate in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. ', 'Alpha technology: A powerful tool to detect mouse brain intracellular signaling events. Background: Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a fundamental molecular process involved in the regulation of signaling activities in living organisms. Understanding this complex network of phosphorylation, especially phosphoproteins, is a necessary step for grasping the basis of cellular pathophysiology. Studying brain intracellular signaling is a particularly complex task due to the heterogeneous complex nature of the brain tissue, which consists of many embedded structures. New method: Overcoming this degree of complexity requires a technology with a high throughput and economical in the amount of biological material used, so that a large number of signaling pathways may be analyzed in a large number of samples. We have turned to Alpha (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) technology. Comparison with existing method: Western blot is certainly the most commonly used method to measure the phosphorylation state of proteins. Even though Western blot is an accurate and reliable method for analyzing modifications of proteins, it is a time-consuming and large amounts of samples are required. Those two parameters are critical when the goal of the research is to comprehend multi-signaling proteic events so as to analyze several targets from small brain areas. Result: Here we demonstrate that Alpha technology is particularly suitable for studying brain signaling pathways by allowing rapid, sensitive, reproducible and semi-quantitative detection of phosphoproteins from individual mouse brain tissue homogenates and from cell fractionation and synaptosomal preparations of mouse hippocampus. Conclusion: Alpha technology represents a major experimental step forward in unraveling the brain phosphoprotein-related molecular mechanisms involved in brain-related disorders.', 'Mitochondria link between cannabinoid and memory. ', 'Pregnenolone blocks cannabinoid-induced acute psychotic-like states in mice. Cannabis-induced acute psychotic-like states (CIAPS) represent a growing health issue, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines against CIAPS is limited by side effects and/or by their ability to tackle only certain aspects of psychosis. Thus, safer wide-spectrum treatments are currently needed. Although the blockade of cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) had been suggested as a therapeutical means against CIAPS, the use of orthosteric CB1 receptor full antagonists is strongly limited by undesired side effects and low efficacy. The neurosteroid pregnenolone has been recently shown to act as a potent endogenous allosteric signal-specific inhibitor of CB1 receptors. Thus, we tested in mice the potential therapeutic use of pregnenolone against acute psychotic-like effects of Δ^9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis. We found that pregnenolone blocks a wide spectrum of THC-induced endophenotypes typically associated with psychotic-like states, including impairments in cognitive functions, somatosensory gating and social interaction. In order to capture THC-induced positive psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. perceptual delusions), we adapted a behavioral paradigm based on associations between different sensory modalities and selective devaluation, allowing the measurement of mental sensory representations in mice. Acting at hippocampal CB1 receptors, THC impaired the correct processing of mental sensory representations (reality testing) in an antipsychotic- and pregnenolone-sensitive manner. Overall, this work reveals that signal-specific inhibitors mimicking pregnenolone effects can be considered as promising new therapeutic tools to treat CIAPS.', 'Astroglial glutamate transporters in the brain: Regulating neurotransmitter homeostasis and synaptic transmission. Astrocytes, the major glial cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), are critical for brain function and have been implicated in various disorders of the central nervous system. These cells are involved in a wide range of cerebral processes including brain metabolism, control of central blood flow, ionic homeostasis, fine-tuning synaptic transmission, and neurotransmitter clearance. Such varied roles can be efficiently carried out due to the intimate interactions astrocytes maintain with neurons, the vasculature, as well as with other glial cells. Arguably, one of the most important functions of astrocytes in the brain is their control of neurotransmitter clearance. This is particularly true for glutamate whose timecourse in the synaptic cleft needs to be controlled tightly under physiological conditions to maintain point-to-point excitatory transmission, thereby limiting spillover and activation of more receptors. Most importantly, accumulation of glutamate in the extracellular space can trigger excessive activation of glutamatergic receptors and lead to excitotoxicity, a trademark of many neurodegenerative diseases. It is thus of utmost importance for both physiological and pathophysiological reasons to understand the processes that control glutamate time course within the synaptic cleft and regulate its concentrations in the extracellular space. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', \"Endocannabinoid modulation of homeostatic and non-homeostatic feeding circuits. The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a key player in the control of eating. Endocannabinoids, including 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), modulate neuronal activity via cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) in multiple nuclei of the hypothalamus to induce or inhibit food intake depending on nutritional and hormonal status, suggesting that endocannabinoids may act in the hypothalamus to integrate different types of signals informing about the animal's energy needs. In the mesocorticolimbic system, (endo)cannabinoids modulate synaptic transmission to promote dopamine release in response to palatable food. In addition, (endo)cannabinoids act within the nucleus accumbens to increase food's hedonic impact; although this effect depends on activation of CB1Rs at excitatory, but not inhibitory inputs in the nucleus accumbens. While hyperactivation of the endocannabinoid system is typically associated with overeating and obesity, much evidence has emerged in recent years suggesting a more complicated system than first thought – endocannabinoids promote or suppress feeding depending on cell and input type, or modulation by various neuronal or hormonal signals. This review presents our latest knowledge of the endocannabinoid system in non-homeostatic and homeostatic feeding circuits. In particular, we discuss the functional role and cellular mechanism of action by endocannabinoids within the hypothalamus and mesocorticolimbic system, and how these are modulated by neuropeptide signals related to feeding. In light of recent advances and complexity in the field, we review cannabinoid-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and how peripheral restriction of CB1R antagonists may provide a different mechanism of weight loss without the central adverse effects.

Auditory \"oddball\" event-related potentials (aoERPs), resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity, and electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms were tested as longitudinal functional biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD). Data were collected at baseline and four follow-ups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients classified in two groups: \"positive\" (i.e., \"prodromal AD\" n=81) or \"negative\" (n=63) based on a diagnostic marker of AD derived from cerebrospinal samples (Aβ 42 /P-tau ratio). A linear mixed model design was used to test functional biomarkers for Group, Time, and Group×Time effects adjusted by nuisance covariates (only data until conversion to dementia was used). Functional biomarkers that showed significant Group effects (\"positive\" versus \"negative\", p<0.05) regardless of Time were 1) reduced rsfMRI connectivity in both the default mode network (DMN) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), both also giving significant Time effects (connectivity decay regardless of Group); 2) increased rsEEG source activity at delta (<4Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) rhythms and decreased source activity at low-frequency alpha (8-10.5Hz) rhythms; and 3) reduced parietal and posterior cingulate source activities of aoERPs. Time×Group effects showed differential functional biomarker progression between groups: 1) increased rsfMRI connectivity in the left parietal cortex of the DMN nodes, consistent with compensatory effects and 2) increased limbic source activity at theta rhythms. These findings represent the first longitudinal characterization of functional biomarkers of prodromal AD relative to \"negative\" aMCI patients based on 5 serial recording sessions over 2 years.', \"Bapineuzumab for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in two global, randomized, phase 3 trials. Background: Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy (clinical and biomarker) and safety of intravenous bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Two of four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month trials were conducted globally: one in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers and another in noncarriers. Patients received bapineuzumab 0.5 mg/kg (both trials) or 1.0 mg/kg (noncarrier trial) or placebo every 13 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 78 on the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and the Disability Assessment for Dementia. Results: A total of 683 and 329 patients completed the current carrier and noncarrier trials, respectively, which were terminated prematurely owing to lack of efficacy in the two other phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in AD. The current trials showed no significant difference between bapineuzumab and placebo for the coprimary endpoints and no effect of bapineuzumab on amyloid load or cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. (Both measures were stable over time in the placebo group.) Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusion were confirmed as the most notable adverse event. Conclusions: These phase 3 global trials confirmed lack of efficacy of bapineuzumab at tested doses on clinical endpoints in patients with mild to moderate AD. Some differences in the biomarker results were seen compared with the other phase 3 bapineuzumab trials. No unexpected adverse events were observed. Trial registration: Noncarriers (3000) ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00667810; registered 24 Apr 2008.

Following a first version AAL of the automated anatomical labeling atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002), a second version (AAL2) (Rolls et al., 2015) was developed that provided an alternative parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex following the description provided by Chiavaras, Petrides, and colleagues. We now provide a third version, AAL3, which adds a number of brain areas not previously defined, but of interest in many neuroimaging investigations. The 26 new areas in the third version are subdivision of the anterior cingulate cortex into subgenual, pregenual and supracallosal parts; subdivision of the thalamus into 15 parts; the nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. The new atlas is available as a toolbox for SPM, and can be used with MRIcron.', \"Benzodiazepine use and brain amyloid load in nondemented older individuals: a florbetapir PET study in the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial cohort. It remains unclear whether benzodiazepines (BZDs) constitute a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated associations between chronic use of BZDs and brain amyloid load, a hallmark of AD, in 268 nondemented older individuals. F18-florbetapir positron emission tomography scans were performed to assess amyloid load as measured by standardized uptake value ratios, which were compared between chronic BZD users and nonusers using adjusted multiple linear regressions. Short- versus long-acting BZDs were also considered in the analyses. Standardized uptake value ratios were significantly lower in BZD users (n = 47) than in nonusers (n = 221), independent of multiple adjustments. The effect was stronger for short-acting BZDs than for long-acting BZDs. This is the first large clinical study showing a reduced brain amyloid load in chronic BZD users, especially with short-acting BZDs. Our results do not support the view of BZD use as a risk factor for AD and instead support the involvement of pharmacological mechanisms related to neuronal hyperactivity, neuroinflammation, and sleep quality as potential targets for blocking amyloid accumulation.\", 'Diagnostic and prognostic value of amyloid PET textural and shape features: comparison with classical semi-quantitative rating in 760 patients from the ADNI-2 database. We evaluated the performance of amyloid PET textural and shape features in discriminating normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects, and in predicting conversion to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or significant memory concern (SMC). Subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with available baseline 18 F-florbetapir and T1-MRI scans were included. The cross-sectional cohort consisted of 181 controls and 148\\xa0AD subjects. The longitudinal cohort consisted of 431 SMC/MCI subjects, 85 of whom converted to AD during follow-up. PET images were normalized to MNI space and post-processed using in-house software. Relative retention indices (SUVr) were computed with respect to pontine, cerebellar, and composite reference regions. Several textural and shape features were extracted then combined using a support vector machine (SVM) to build a predictive model of AD conversion. Diagnostic and prognostic performance was evaluated using ROC analysis and survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model. The three SUVr and all the tested features effectively discriminated AD subjects in cross-sectional analysis (all p < 0.001). In longitudinal analysis, the variables with the highest prognostic value were composite SUVr (AUC 0.86; accuracy 81%), skewness (0.87; 83%), local minima (0.85; 79%), Geary’s index (0.86; 81%), gradient norm maximal argument (0.83; 82%), and the SVM model (0.91; 86%). The adjusted hazard ratio for AD conversion was 5.5 for the SVM model, compared with 4.0, 2.6, and 3.8 for cerebellar, pontine and composite SUVr (all p < 0.001), indicating that appropriate amyloid textural and shape features predict conversion to AD with at least as good accuracy as classical SUVr.', 'MR perfusion lesions after TIA or minor stroke are associated with new infarction at 7 days. Objective: To investigate the relationship between acute perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) lesions occurring within the first hours after a TIA or a minor brain infarction (BI) and the incidence of new BI detected on a systematic MRI at 1 week. Methods: Consecutive patients who experienced a TIA or BI with a neurologic deficit that lasted <24 hours, did not receive any revascularization therapy (thrombolysis/thrombectomy), and underwent DWI/PWI at baseline and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)/DWI 1 week after symptom onset were enrolled. Investigators blinded to clinical information independently assessed the presence of acute ischemic lesions on baseline DWI/PWI and follow-up DWI and FLAIR. Baseline and follow-up MRIs were then compared to determine the occurrence and location of new infarctions. Results: Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Median (IQR) ABCD2 score was 4 (3-5). Median delay from onset to baseline and follow-up MRI was 5 (2-10) hours and 6 (5-7) days, respectively. MRI revealed an acute ischemic lesion on DWI and/or PWI in 38 patients. Nine patients (14%) had a new infarction on follow-up MRI. Each had a PWI and 4 had a DWI lesion on baseline MRI. All new BIs except one were asymptomatic and in the same location as the acute PWI lesion. Conclusions: Our results showed that 30% of the acute focal PWI lesions detected after a TIA are associated with a new BI at 1 week. Those new BIs may result from the progression of the initial ischemic injury.', 'Frontal-midline theta frequency and probabilistic learning: A transcranial alternating current stimulation study. Probabilistic learning is a fundamental cognitive ability that extracts and represents regularities of our environment enabling predictive processing during perception and acquisition of perceptual, motor, cognitive, and social skills. Previous studies show competition between neural networks related to executive function/working memory vs. probabilistic learning. Theta synchronization has been associated with the former while desynchronization with the latter in correlational studies. In the present paper our aim was to test causal relationship between fronto-parietal midline theta synchronization and probabilistic learning with non-invasive transcranial alternating current (tACS) stimulation. We hypothesize that theta synchronization disrupts probabilistic learning performance by modulating the competitive relationship. Twenty-six young adults performed the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess probabilistic learning in two sessions that took place one week apart. Stimulation was applied in a double-blind cross-over within-subject design with an active theta tACS and a sham stimulation in a counter-balanced order between participants. Sinusoidal current was administered with 1 mA peak-to-peak intensity throughout the task (approximately 20 min) for the active stimulation and 30 s for the sham. We did not find an effect of fronto-parietal midline theta tACS on probabilistic learning comparing performance during active and sham stimulation. To influence probabilistic learning, we suggest applying higher current intensity and stimulation parameters more precisely aligned to endogenous brain activity for future studies.', \"Language Network Connectivity Increases in Early Alzheimer's Disease. Background: Language production deficits occur early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, only a few studies have focused on language network's functional connectivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Objective: The current study aims to uncover the extent of language alteration at the MCI stage, at a behavioral and neural level, using univariate and multivariate analyses of structural MRI and resting-state fMRI. Methods: Twenty-four MCI due to AD participants and 24 matched healthy controls underwent a comprehensive language evaluation, a structural T1-3D MRI, and resting-state fMRI. We performed seed-based analyses, using the left inferior frontal gyrus and left posterior temporal gyrus as seeds. Then, we analyzed connectivity between executive control networks and language network in each group. Finally, we used multivariate pattern analyses to test whether the two groups could be distinguished based on the pattern of atrophy within the language network; within the executive control networks, as well as the pattern of functional connectivity within the language network and within the executive control networks. Results: MCI due to AD participants had language impairment during standardized language tasks and connected-speech production. Regarding functional connectivity, univariate analyses were not able to discriminate participants, while multivariate pattern analyses could significantly predict participants' group. Language network's functional connectivity could discriminate MCI due to AD participants better than executive control networks. Most notably, they revealed an increased connectivity at the MCI stage, positively correlated with language performance. Conclusion: Multivariate analyses represent a useful tool for investigating the functional and structural (re-)organization of the neural bases of language.\", 'PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability. Endothelial cells serve as a barrier between blood and tissues. Maintenance of the endothelial cell barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions, which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the ζ isoform of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3). We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain-containing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial cell-specific overexpression of Pdzrn3 led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of Pdzrn3 prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex containing PAR3, PKCζ, and themulti-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost-multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was associated with decreased localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular junctions. In endothelial cells, Pdzrn3 overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-dependent pathway. In contrast, Pdzrn3 depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates vascular permeability through a PKCζ-containing complex.', 'Automatic bad channel detection in intracranial electroencephalographic recordings using ensemble machine learning. Objective: Intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings contain “bad channels” which show non-neuronal signals. Here, we developed a new method that automatically detects iEEG bad channels using machine learning of seven signal features. Methods: The features quantified signals’ variance, spatial–temporal correlation and nonlinear properties. Because the number of bad channels is usually much lower than the number of good channels, we implemented an ensemble bagging classifier known to be optimal in terms of stability and predictive accuracy for datasets with imbalanced class distributions. This method was applied on stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recording during low frequency stimulations performed in 206 patients from 5 clinical centers. Results: We found that the classification accuracy was extremely good: It increased with the number of subjects used to train the classifier and reached a plateau at 99.77% for 110 subjects. The classification performance was thus not impacted by the multicentric nature of data. Conclusions: The proposed method to automatically detect bad channels demonstrated convincing results and can be envisaged to be used on larger datasets for automatic quality control of iEEG data. Significance: This is the first method proposed to classify bad channels in iEEG and should allow to improve the data selection when reviewing iEEG signals.', 'Glioblastoma as differential diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. Objective: To identify the clinical and radiological features that should raise suspicion for the autoimmune encephalitis (AE)-like presentation of glioblastoma. Methods: This is an observational, retrospective case series of patients referred to the French National Reference Center on Paraneoplastic Neurological Diseases for suspected AE (possible, probable or definite, using the 2016 criteria) who later received a final diagnosis of glioblastoma according to 2016 WHO criteria. An extensive literature search was also conducted for similar existing cases. Results: Between 2014 and 2016, 306 patients were referred to our center for suspected AE. Six of these patients (2%) later developed pathologically confirmed glioblastoma. Thirteen patients (9 male) were included for analysis (6 from the present series and 7 from the literature); median age was 63. Initially, a diagnosis of AE was clinically suspected based on: working memory deficits (77%), seizures (62%) (including status epilepticus in 23%), and psychiatric symptoms (46%). Initial brain MRI was not in favor of a typical glioblastoma pattern and showed bilateral (54%) or unilateral selective limbic involvement. Five patients exhibited initial slight contrast enhancement. A clear inflammatory CSF was present in five patients and three from the literature showed autoantibody positivity (NMDAR, VGKC, GluRepsilon2). Median delay between suspicions of AE to GBM diagnosis was 3\\xa0months (range 1.5–24) and one patient from the literature was diagnosed post-mortem. Conclusions: An alternative diagnosis of glioblastoma should be considered in patients presenting initially as AE, especially in patients who do not fulfill the criteria for definite AE and in those with a poor clinical evolution despite initial improvement.', 'Study of relationship between dose, LET and the risk of brain necrosis after proton therapy for skull base tumors. Purpose: We investigated the relationship between RBE-weighted dose (DRBE) calculated with constant (cRBE) and variable RBE (vRBE), dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) and the risk of radiographic changes in skull base patients treated with protons. Methods: Clinical treatment plans of 45 patients were recalculated with Monte Carlo tool FRED. Radiographic changes (i.e. edema and/or necrosis) were identified by MRI. Dosimetric parameters for cRBE and vRBE were computed. Biological margin extension and voxel-based analysis were employed looking for association of DRBE(vRBE) and LETd with brain edema and/or necrosis. Results: When using vRBE, Dmax in the brain was above the highest dose limits for 38% of patients, while such limit was never exceeded assuming cRBE. Similar values of Dmax were observed in necrotic regions, brain and temporal lobes. Most of the brain necrosis was in proximity to the PTV. The voxel-based analysis did not show evidence of an association with high LETd values. Conclusions: When looking at standard dosimetric parameters, the higher dose associated with vRBE seems to be responsible for an enhanced risk of radiographic changes. However, as revealed by a voxel-based analysis, the large inter-patient variability hinders the identification of a clear effect for high LETd.', \"Safety, tolerability, and activity of mesenchymal stem cells versus placebo in multiple sclerosis (MESEMS): a phase 2, randomised, double-blind crossover trial. Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also known as mesenchymal stromal cells, have been proposed as a promising therapeutic option for people with multiple sclerosis on the basis of their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties. The MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis (MESEMS) study was devised to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of autologous MSCs derived from bone marrow and infused intravenously in patients with active multiple sclerosis. Methods: MESEMS is a randomised phase 2 trial done at 15 sites in nine countries. Patients (aged 18–50 years) with active relapsing-remitting or progressive multiple sclerosis were included if they had a disease duration of 2–15 years since onset of multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 2·5–6·5. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), according to a crossover design, to receive a single intravenous dose of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs followed by placebo at week 24, or to receive placebo followed by autologous MSCs at week 24, with a follow-up visit at week 48. Primary objectives were to test safety and activity of MSC treatment. The primary safety endpoint was to assess the number and severity of adverse events within each treatment arm. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (GELs) counted over week 4, 12, and 24 compared between treatment groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed in the full analyis set, after all participants completed the week 24 visit. Efficacy endpoints were evaluated using a predefined statistical testing procedure. Safety was monitored throughout the study by recording vital signs and adverse events at each visit. Findings: From July 16, 2012, until July 31, 2019, 144 patients were randomly assigned to first receive early intravenous infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs (n=69) or placebo (n=75). MSC treatment did not meet the primary endpoint of efficacy on the total number of GELs accumulated from baseline to week 24 (rate ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·58–1·50; p=0·78). 213 adverse events were recorded, similarly distributed between groups (93 cases recorded in 35 [51%] of 69 patients treated first with MSCs vs 120 cases in 42 [56%] of 75 patients infused first with placebo). The most frequent adverse events reported were infection and infestations, with a total of 54 (25%) of 213 adverse events (18 [19%] of 93 in the early-MSC group and 36 [30%] of 120 in the delayed-MSC group). Nine serious adverse events were reported in seven patients treated with placebo versus none in the MSC group. All serious adverse events were considered to be unrelated to the treatment infusion. No deaths were reported during the study. Interpretation: Bone marrow-derived MSC treatment was safe and well tolerated but did not show an effect on GELs, an MRI surrogate marker of acute inflammation, in patients with active forms of multiple sclerosis, at week 24. Thus, this study does not support the use of bone marrow-derived MSCs to treat active multiple sclerosis. Further studies should address the effect of MSCs on parameters related to tissue repair.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a very diverse group of disorders but they share some common mechanisms such as abnormally misfolded proteins with prion-like propagation and aggregation. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most prevalent prion disease in humans. In the sporadic form of CJD the only known risk factor is the codon 129 polymorphism. Recent reports suggested that α-synuclein in multiple system atrophy (MSA) has similar pathogenic mechanisms as the prion protein. Here we present 1 Italian family with MSA and prion disease. Also, cases of concurrent MSA and prion pathology in the same individual or family suggest the possibility of molecular interaction between prion protein and α-synuclein in the process of protein accumulation and neurodegeneration, warranting further investigations. We assessed the PRNP gene by whole-exome sequencing in 264 pathologically confirmed MSA cases and 462 healthy controls to determine whether the 2 diseases share similar risk factors. We then analyzed codon 129 polymorphism by Sanger sequencing and compared with previously published results in sporadic CJD. Homozygosity at codon 129 was present in 50% of pathologically confirmed MSA cases and in 58% of normal controls (odds ratio, 0.7 (95% confidence interval of 0.5–0.9)) compared with 88.2% in sporadic CJD. Our data show that the homozygous state of position 129 in the PRNP is not a risk factor for MSA. No other variants in the PRNP gene were associated with increased risk for MSA.', \"Maladaptive compensation of right fusiform gyrus in developmental dyslexia: A hub-based white matter network analysis. Cognitive theories have been proposed to clarify the causes and symptoms of dyslexia. However, correlations between local network parameters of white matter connectivity and literacy skills remain poorly known. An unbiased hypothesis-free approach was adopted to examine the correlations between literacy symptoms (reading and spelling) and hub-based white matter networks' connectivity parameters [nodal degree fractional anisotropy (FA) values] of 90 brain regions based on Anatomical Atlas Labels (AAL) in a group of French children with dyslexia aged 9–14 years. Results revealed that the higher the right fusiform gyrus's (FFG) nodal degree FA values, the lower the reading accuracy for words and pseudowords in dyslexic children. The results indicate that the severity of word/pseudoword reading symptoms in dyslexia relates to a white matter network centered around the right FFG. The negative correlation between right FFG network connectivity and reading accuracy, in particular pseudoword reading accuracy, suggests that right FFG represents a maladaptive compensation towards a general orthography-to-phonology decoding ability in developmental dyslexia.\", 'Schizotypy and altered hemispheric asymmetries: The role of cilia genes. Schizophrenia patients have a higher probability of altered structural and functional differences between the left and right hemisphere. Schizotypy as its nonclinical manifestation has been related to a higher incidence of non-right-handedness and atypical right-hemispheric language dominance. It has been suggested that genes involved in cilia function might link brain asymmetry and neurodevelopmental disorders. We assessed DNA methylation in the promoter regions of seven candidate genes involved in cilia function and psychiatric disorders from buccal cells and investigated their association with schizotypy and language lateralization in 60 healthy adults. Moreover, we determined microstructural properties of the planum temporale in a subsample of 52 subjects using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). We found a significant association between schizotypy and DNA methylation in the AHI1 promoter region. Moreover, AHI1 DNA methylation significantly predicted language lateralization and asymmetry in estimated planum temporale neurite density. Finally, stronger leftward asymmetry in estimated neurite density was associated with a more pronounced right ear advantage (left hemisphere dominance) in the forced-right condition of the dichotic listening task, measuring attentional modulation of language lateralization. Our results are in line with a shared molecular basis of schizotypy and functional hemispheric asymmetries that is based on cilia function.', \"Microarray and Mass Spectrometry-Based Methodology for Lipid Profiling of Tissues and Cell Cultures. The recent developments in mass spectrometry have revealed the importance of lipids as biomarkers in the context of different diseases and as indicators of the cell's homeostasis. However, further advances are required to unveil the complex relationships between lipid classes and lipid species with proteins. Here, we present a new methodology that combines microarrays with mass spectrometry to obtain the lipid fingerprint of samples of a different nature in a standardized and fast way, with minimal sample consumption. As a proof of concept, we use the methodology to obtain the lipid fingerprint of 20 rat tissues and to create a lipid library for tissue classification. Then, we combine those results with immunohistochemistry and enzymatic assays to unveil the relationship between some lipid species and two enzymes. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the methodology to explore changes in lipid composition of the nucleus accumbens from mice subjected to two lipid diets.\", 'The spinal and cerebral profile of adult spinal-muscular atrophy: A multimodal imaging study. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III and IV are autosomal recessive, slowly progressive lower motor neuron syndromes. Nevertheless, wider cerebral involvement has been consistently reported in mouse models. The objective of this study is the characterisation of spinal and cerebral pathology in adult forms of SMA using multimodal quantitative imaging. Methods: Twenty-five type III and IV adult SMA patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in a spinal cord and brain imaging study. Structural measures of grey and white matter involvement and diffusion parameters of white matter integrity were evaluated at each cervical spinal level. Whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses were also conducted in the brain to explore cortical thickness, grey matter density and tract-based white matter alterations. Results: In the spinal cord, considerable grey matter atrophy was detected between C2-C6 vertebral levels. In the brain, increased grey matter density was detected in motor and extra-motor regions of SMA patients. No white matter pathology was identified neither at brain and spinal level. Conclusions: Adult forms of SMA are associated with selective grey matter degeneration in the spinal cord with preserved white matter integrity. The observed increased grey matter density in the motor cortex may represent adaptive reorganisation.', 'Amyloid precursor protein in drosophila glia regulates sleep and genes involved in glutamate recycling. Amyloid precursor protein (App) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer’s disease via the production and deposition of toxic β-amyloid peptides. App is heavily expressed in neurons, the focus of the vast majority of studies investigating its function. Meanwhile, almost nothing is known about App’s function in glia, where it is also expressed, and can potentially participate in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In this report, we investigated whether Appl, the Drosophila homolog of App, could influence sleep–wake regulation when its function is manipulated in glial cells. Appl inhibition in astrocyte-like and cortex glia resulted in higher sleep amounts and longer sleep bout duration during the night, while overexpression had the opposite effect. These sleep phenotypes were not the result of developmental defects, and were correlated with changes in expression in glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocyte-like glia and in changes in the gap-junction component innexin2 in cortex glia. Downregulating both GS and innexin2, but not either one individually, resulted in higher sleep amounts, similarly to Appl inhibition. Consistent with these results, the expression of GS and innexin2 are increased following sleep deprivation, indicating that GS and innexin2 genes are dynamically linked to vigilance states. Interestingly, the reduction of GS expression and the sleep phenotype observed upon Appl inhibition could be rescued by increasing the expression of the glutamate transporter dEaat1. In contrast, reducing dEaat1 expression severely disrupted sleep. These results associate glutamate recycling, sleep, and a glial function for the App family proteins.', 'Indications and limits of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Epilepsy surgery is now an accepted treatment to achieve seizure control in carefully selected patients, both children and adults, suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Although surgical strategies can often be defined on the basis of non-invasive diagnostic procedures, and despite the recent advances in this field, an increasing number of more complex cases requires invasive EEG (iEEG) to provide precise information on the localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), its relationships with eloquent cortex (EC), and the feasibility of a tailored surgical resection. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is one of the iEEG techniques currently used in the presurgical work-up, and it is well-distinguished from other invasive techniques, such as subdural grids and strips. SEEG depth electrodes enable exploration of deeply located structures and lesions, and of buried cortex, which are not easily assessable by subdural or other iEEG methods. Simultaneous recording of SEEG signals from deep and superficial brain structures allows, when the position of each electrode is precisely determined, delineation of a three-dimensional, spatial and temporal organization of epileptic activities. In the following chapter we discuss some specific indications (temporal or extra-temporal, lesional or non-lesional epilepsies) as well as the limits of the SEEG technique, with respect to some epileptological issues during presurgical evaluation.', 'Curcumin as prospective anti-aging natural compound: Focus on brain. The nutrients and their potential benefits are a new field of study in modern medicine for their positive impact on health. Curcumin, the yellow polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa species, is widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to prevent and contrast many diseases, considering its antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, cardio-protective, nephron-protective, hepato-protective, anti-neoplastic, and anti-rheumatic proprieties. In recent years, the investigations of curcumin have been focused on its application to aging and age-associated diseases. Aging is a physiological process in which there is a decreasing of cellular function due to internal or external stimuli. Oxidative stress is one of the most important causes of aging and age-related diseases. Moreover, many age-related disorders such as cancer, neuroinflammation, and infections are due to a low-grade chronic systemic inflammation. Curcumin acting on different proteins is able to contrast both oxidative stress than inflammation. In the brain, curcumin is able to modulate inflammation induced by microglia. Finally in brain tumors curcumin is able to reduce tumor growth by inhibition of telomerase activity. This review emphasizes the anti-aging role of curcumin focusing on its mechanism to counteract aging in the brain. Moreover, new formulations to increase the bioavailability of curcumin are discussed.', \"First clinical inflammatory demyelinating events of the central nervous system in a population aged over 70 years: A multicentre study. Background: Few data are available regarding patients with very late-onset inflammatory demyelinating events. (VLO-IDE). Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics and aetiological diagnosis of very late first inflammatory demyelinating events of the central nervous system. Methods: We conducted a national descriptive retrospective multicentre study on a case series of patients aged >70 years at the time of VLO-IDE. Patients were recruited from a national call on behalf of the 'Société Francophone de la Sclérose en Plaques' (French Multiple Sclerosis Society). Results: Twenty-five patients were referred (F:M sex ratio 2.1:1). The most frequent clinical impairment was a spinal cord deficit (23/25), usually severe (disability score, median EDSS 4.5 [2–9.5]). Spinal cord lesions were usually extensive, spanning at least three segments (11/25), and large brain lesions were also observed (lesions >20 mm in 6/25). The final aetiological diagnoses comprised multiple sclerosis (9/25), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (7/25), neurosystemic lupus erythematosus (2/25), transverse myelitis without aetiological diagnosis (6/25) and optic neuritis (1/25). Conclusions: This study highlights a particular phenotype of first clinical inflammatory demyelinating events in predominantly female patients aged >70 years who have severe motor impairment with common longitudinal extensive myelitis and large and common very active radiological inflammatory lesions. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders seem overrepresented.\", 'Higher b-values improve the correlation between diffusion MRI and the cortical microarchitecture. Purpose: In diffusion MRI (dMRI), it remains unclear to know how much increase of b-value is conveying additional biological meaning. We tested the correlations between cortical microarchitecture and diffusion metrics computed from standard (1000\\xa0s/mm2), high (3000\\xa0s/mm2), to very high (5000\\xa0s/mm2) b-value dMRI. Methods: Healthy volunteers were scanned with a dMRI pulse sequence that was first optimized together with a T1-WI and T2-WI. Averaged cortical surface map of estimated myelin (T1-WI/T2-WI) was compared with surface maps of mean diffusivity (MD) computed from each b-value (MD1000, MD3000, and MD5000) and to surface map of mean kurtosis (MK computed from the 0-, 1000-, to 3000-s/mm2 shells) in 360 cortical parcels using Spearman correlations, multiple linear regressions, and Akaike information criteria (AIC). Results: Surface map from MD1000 showed variations not related to myelin but the MD3000 and MD5000 maps inversely mirrored estimated myelin map; lower MD values being observed in more myelinated cortical areas. MK mirrored myelinated cortical areas. Quantitatively, Spearman correlations between myelin and MD became more and more negative as long as b-values increased while the correlation was positive between myelin and MK. Multiple regression models confirmed negative associations between myelin and MD that were significantly better from MD1000 to MD3000 and MD5000 (R2 = 0.33, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.43, p < 0.001; and R2 = 0.50, p < 0.001) and positive association between myelin and MK (R2 = 0.53, p < 0.001). Comparisons of the 3 statistical models showed the best performances with MK and MD5000 (AICMK < AICMD5000 < AICMD3000 < AICMD1000). Conclusion: Higher b-values are more closely related to subtle cellular variations of the cortical microarchitecture.', 'TRIM9 and TRIM67 Are New Targets in Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration. To describe autoantibodies (Abs) against tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein 9 and 67 in two patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Abs were characterized using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, cultures of murine cortical, and hippocampal neurons, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, knockout mice for Trim9 and 67, and cell-based assay. Control samples included sera from 63 patients with small cell lung cancer without any paraneoplastic neurological syndrome, 36 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and PNS, CSF from 100 patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and CSF from 165 patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We found Abs targeting TRIM9 and TRIM67 at high concentration in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a 78-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man. Both developed subacute severe cerebellar ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging found no abnormality and no cerebellar atrophy. Both had CSF inflammation with mild pleiocytosis and a few oligoclonal bands. We identified a pulmonary adenocarcinoma, confirming the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome in both patients. They received immunomodulatory and cancer treatments without improvement of cerebellar ataxia, even though both were in remission of their cancer (for more than 10\\xa0years in one patient). Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs were specific to these two patients. All control serum and CSF samples tested were negative for anti-TRIM9 and 67. Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs appeared to be specific biomarkers of PCD and should be added to the panel of antigens tested when this is suspected.', 'Data descriptor: Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse brain and lung vascular and vessel-associated cell types. Vascular diseases are major causes of death, yet our understanding of the cellular constituents of blood vessels, including how differences in their gene expression profiles create diversity in vascular structure and function, is limited. In this paper, we describe a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset that defines vascular and vessel-associated cell types and subtypes in mouse brain and lung. The dataset contains 3,436 single cell transcriptomes from mouse brain, which formed 15 distinct clusters corresponding to cell (sub) types, and another 1,504 single cell transcriptomes from mouse lung, which formed 17 cell clusters. In order to allow user-friendly access to our data, we constructed a searchable database (http://betsholtzlab.org/ VascularSingleCells/database.html). Our dataset constitutes a comprehensive molecular atlas of vascular and vessel-associated cell types in the mouse brain and lung, and as such provides a strong foundation for future studies of vascular development and diseases.', \"Brain imaging of locomotion in neurological conditions. Impaired locomotion is a frequent and major source of disability in patients with neurological conditions. Different neuroimaging methods have been used to understand the brain substrates of locomotion in various neurological diseases (mainly in Parkinson's disease) during actual walking, and while resting (using mental imagery of gait, or brain-behavior correlation analyses). These studies, using structural (i.e., MRI) or functional (i.e., functional MRI or functional near infra-red spectroscopy) brain imaging, electrophysiology (i.e., EEG), non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation) or molecular imaging methods (i.e., PET, or SPECT) reveal extended brain networks involving both grey and white matters in key cortical (i.e., prefrontal cortex) and subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellum) regions associated with locomotion. However, the specific roles of the various pathophysiological mechanisms encountered in each neurological condition on the phenotype of gait disorders still remains unclear. After reviewing the results of individual brain imaging techniques across the common neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, or multiple sclerosis, we will discuss how the development of new imaging techniques and computational analyses that integrate multivariate correlations in “large enough datasets” might help to understand how individual pathophysiological mechanisms express clinically as an abnormal gait. Finally, we will explore how these new analytic methods could drive our rehabilitative strategies.\", 'Prader-Willi syndrome: A model for understanding the ghrelin system. Subsequent to the discovery of ghrelin as the endogenous ligand of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a, this unique gut peptide has been found to exert numerous physiological effects, such as appetite stimulation and lipid accumulation via the central regulating mechanisms in the hypothalamus, stimulation of gastric motility, regulation of glucose metabolism and brown fat thermogenesis, and modulation of stress, anxiety, taste sensation, reward-seeking behaviour and the sleep/wake cycle. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has been described as a unique pathological state characterised by severe obesity and high circulating levels of ghrelin. It was hypothesised that hyperghrelinaemia would explain at least a part of the feeding behaviour and body composition of PWS patients, who are characterised by hyperphagia, an obsession with food and food-seeking, and increased adiposity. Initially, the link between hyperghrelinaemia and growth hormone deficiency, which is observed in 90% of the children with PWS, was not fully understood. Over the years, however, the increasing knowledge on ghrelin, PWS features and the natural history of the disease has led to a more comprehensive description of the abnormal ghrelin system and its role in the pathophysiology of this rare and complex neurodevelopmental genetic disease. In the present study, we (a) present the current view of PWS; (b) explain its natural history, including recent data on the ghrelin system in PWS patients; and (c) discuss the therapeutic approach of modulating the ghrelin system in these patients and the first promising results.', \"AMYPAD Diagnostic and Patient Management Study: Rationale and design. Introduction: Reimbursement of amyloid–positron emission tomography (PET) is lagging due to the lack of definitive evidence on its clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. The Amyloid Imaging to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease–Diagnostic and Patient Management Study (AMYPAD-DPMS) is designed to fill this gap. Methods: AMYPAD-DPMS is a phase 4, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. Nine hundred patients with subjective cognitive decline plus, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia possibly due to Alzheimer's disease will be randomized to ARM1, amyloid-PET performed early in the diagnostic workup; ARM2, amyloid-PET performed after 8 months; and ARM3, amyloid-PET performed whenever the physician chooses to do so. Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the difference between ARM1 and ARM2 in the proportion of patients receiving a very-high-confidence etiologic diagnosis after 3 months. Secondary endpoints address diagnosis and diagnostic confidence, diagnostic/therapeutic management, health economics and patient-related outcomes, and methods for image quantitation. Expected Impacts: AMYPAD-DPMS will supply physicians and health care payers with real-world data to plan management decisions.\", 'Deep learning in spiking neural networks. In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons’ transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.', 'ProNGF involvement in the adult neurogenesis disfunction in alzheimer’s disease. In recent decades, neurogenesis in the adult brain has been well demonstrated in a number of animal species, including humans. Interestingly, work with rodents has shown that adult neuro-genesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is vital for some cognitive aspects, as increas-ing neurogenesis improves memory, while its disruption triggers the opposite effect. Adult neuro-genesis declines with age and has been suggested to play a role in impaired progressive learning and memory loss seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutic strategies designed to boost adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be beneficial for the treatment of AD. The precursor forms of neurotrophins, such as pro-NGF, display remarkable increase during AD in the hippocam-pus and entorhinal cortex. In contrast to mature NGF, pro-NGF exerts adverse functions in survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that pro-NGF and its p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contribute to disrupting adult hippocampal neurogenesis during AD. To test this hypothesis, in this study, we took advantage of the availability of mouse models of AD (APP/PS1), which display memory impairment, and AD human samples to address the role of pro-NGF/p75NTR signaling in different aspects of adult neurogenesis. First, we observe that DG dou-blecortin (DCX) + progenitors express p75NTR both, in healthy humans and control animals, alt-hough the percentage of DCX+ cells are significantly reduced in AD. Interestingly, the expression of p75NTR in these progenitors is significantly decreased in AD conditions compared to controls. In order to assess the contribution of the pro-NGF/p75NTR pathway to the memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice, we inject pro-NGF neutralizing antibodies (anti-proNGF) into the DG of control and APP/PS1 mice and animals are subjected to a Morris water maze test. Intriguingly, we observe that anti-pro-NGF significantly restored memory performance of APP/PS1 animals and significantly increase the percentage of DCX+ progenitors in the DG region of these animals. In summary, our results suggest that pro-NGF is involved in disrupting spatial memory in AD, at least in part by blocking adult neurogenesis. Moreover, we propose that adult neurogenesis alteration should be taken in consideration for better understanding of AD pathology and, additionally, we provide a new molecular entry point (pro-NGF/p75NTR signaling) as a promising therapeutic target in AD.', 'Electrophysiological correlates of emotional crossmodal processing in binge drinking. Emotional crossmodal integration (i.e., multisensorial decoding of emotions) is a crucial process that ensures adaptive social behaviors and responses to the environment. Recent evidence suggests that in binge drinking—an excessive alcohol consumption pattern associated with psychological and cerebral deficits—crossmodal integration is preserved at the behavioral level. Although some studies have suggested brain modifications during affective processing in binge drinking, nothing is known about the cerebral correlates of crossmodal integration. In the current study, we asked 53 university students (17 binge drinkers, 17 moderate drinkers, 19 nondrinkers) to perform an emotional crossmodal task while their behavioral and neurophysiological responses were recorded. Participants had to identify happiness and anger in three conditions (unimodal, crossmodal congruent, crossmodal incongruent) and two modalities (face and/or voice). Binge drinkers did not significantly differ from moderate drinkers and nondrinkers at the behavioral level. However, widespread cerebral modifications were found at perceptual (N100) and mainly at decisional (P3b) stages in binge drinkers, indexed by slower brain processing and stronger activity. These cerebral modifications were mostly related to anger processing and crossmodal integration. This study highlights higher electrophysiological activity in the absence of behavioral deficits, which could index a potential compensation process in binge drinkers. In line with results found in severe alcohol-use disorders, these electrophysiological findings show modified anger processing, which might have a deleterious impact on social functioning. Moreover, this study suggests impaired crossmodal integration at early stages of alcohol-related disorders.', 'Neural correlates of binding lyrics and melodies for the encoding of new songs. Songs naturally bind lyrics and melody into a unified representation. Using a subsequent memory paradigm, we examined the neural processes associated with binding lyrics and melodies during song encoding. Participants were presented with songs in two conditions: a unified condition (melodies sung with lyrics), and a separate condition (melodies sung with the syllable \"la\"). In both cases, written lyrics were displayed and participants were instructed to memorize them by repeating them covertly or by generating mental images of the songs. We expected the unified condition to recruit the posterior superior temporal gyrus, known to be involved in perceptual integration of songs, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Conversely, we hypothesized that the separate condition would engage a larger network including the hippocampus to bind lyrics and melodies of songs, and the basal ganglia and the cerebellum to ensure the correct sequence coupling of verbal and musical information in time. Binding lyrics and melodies in the unified condition revealed activation of the left IFG, bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and left motor cortex, suggesting a strong linguistic processing for this condition. Binding in the separate compared to the unified condition revealed greater activity in the right hippocampus as well as other areas including the left caudate, left cerebellum, and right IFG. This study provides novel evidence for the role of the right hippocampus in binding lyrics and melodies in songs. Results are discussed in light of studies of binding in the visual domain and highlight the role of regions involved in timing and synchronization such as the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.', 'Oxytocin and serotonin brain mechanisms in the nonhuman primate. Oxytocin (OT) is increasingly studied for its therapeutic potential in psychiatric disorders, which are associated with the deregulation of several neurotransmission systems. Studies in rodents demonstrated that the interaction between OT and serotonin (5-HT) is critical for several aspects of social behavior. Using PET scan in humans, we have recently found that 5-HT 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) function is modified after intranasal oxytocin intake. However, the underlying mechanism between OT and 5-HT remains unclear. To understand this interaction, we tested 3 male macaque monkeys using both [11C]DASB and [18F]MPPF, two PET radiotracers, marking the serotonin transporter and the 5-HT1AR, respectively. Oxytocin (1 IU in 20 μl of ACSF) or placebo was injected into the brain lateral ventricle 45 min before scans. Additionally, we performed postmortem autoradiography. Compared with placebo, OT significantly reduced [11C]DASB binding potential in right amygdala, insula, and hippocampus, whereas [18F]MPPF binding potential increased in right amygdala and insula. Autoradiography revealed that [11C]DASB was sensitive to physiological levels of 5-HT modification, and that OT does not act directly on the 5-HT1AR. Our results show that oxytocin administration in nonhuman primates influences serotoninergic neurotransmission via at least two ways: (1) by provoking a release of serotonin in key limbic regions; and (2) by increasing the availability of 5-HT1AR receptors in the same limbic areas. Because these two molecules are important for social behavior, our study sheds light on the specific nature of their interaction, therefore helping to develop new mechanisms-based therapies for psychiatric disorders.', 'The elusive tau molecular structures: Can we translate the recent breakthroughs into new targets for intervention?. Insights into tau molecular structures have advanced significantly in recent years. This field has been the subject of recent breakthroughs, including the first cryo-electron microscopy structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s and Pick’s disease inclusions, as well as the structure of the repeat regions of tau bound to microtubules. Tau structure covers various species as the tau protein itself takes many forms. We will here address a range of studies that help to define the many facets of tau protein structures and how they translate into pathogenic forms. New results shed light on previous data that need now to be revisited in order to up-date our knowledge of tau molecular structure. Finally, we explore how these data can contribute the important medical aspects of this research - diagnosis and therapeutics.', 'Radiological and clinical features of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in newborns and older children. Background and purpose: Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) represents an increasingly recognized cause of pediatric stroke. Our purpose was to assess gender and age differences in the etiology, clinical presentation, and imaging features of CSVT in neonates and older children. Methods: Subjects aged newborn to 18 years diagnosed with CSVT at the Lille university hospital between 2011 and 2014 were included. Results: Eleven neonates and 16 non-neonates constituted the study population. The incidence of CSVT was significantly higher in male newborns. Clinical presentation did not vary significantly between the groups. Risk factors were age-dependent, with acute systemic illnesses significantly predominating in neonates (54%), whereas local infections, prothrombotic conditions, and trauma were more common in older children (36, 27, and 27% respectively). No predisposing factor could be identified in 36% of the neonates as compared to less than 5% of the non-neonates. Thrombosis of the deep venous structures was documented in 73% of the neonates whereas involvement of the superficial sinuses was significantly more frequent in the non-neonates group. Venous infarctions and extraparenchymal hemorrhages were significantly more frequent in the neonates group. Conclusion: Male patients are at higher risk for CSVT than females. In neonates, involvement of the deep venous structures is significantly more common. Brain parenchymal and extraparenchymal changes occur more frequently in this age group than in older children.', 'Uptake of parasite-derived vesicles by astrocytes and microglial phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes may drive neuroinflammation in cerebral malaria. Astrocytes and microglia are activated during cerebral malaria (CM) and contribute to the production and release of several mediators during neuroinflammatory processes. Whether these changes are the consequence of a direct crosstalk between glial cells and the malarial parasite and how these cells participate in the pathogenesis of CM is not yet clear. We therefore examined the interaction of astrocytes and microglia with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected red blood cells using primary cell cultures derived from newborn C57BL/6 mice. We observed a dynamic transfer of vesicles from the parasite to astrocytes within minutes of contact, and the phagocytosis of infected red blood cells by microglia. Differential gene expression studies using the Affymetrix GeneChip® microarray, and quantitative PCR analyses showed the increase in expression of the set of genes belonging to the immune response network in parasite activated astrocytes and microglia. Interestingly, expression of these genes was also significantly upregulated in brains of mice dying from CM compared with uninfected mice or infected mice that did not develop the neuropathology. Accumulation of parasite-derived vesicles within astrocytes, and the phagocytosis of infected red blood cells by microglia induced a subsequent increase in interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (IP10) in both the brain and plasma of infected mice at the onset of CM, confirming a role for this molecule in CM pathogenesis. Altogether, these observations point to a possible role for glial cells in the neuropathological processes leading to CM. GLIA 2016 GLIA 2017;65:75–92.', \"Is Low Psychomotor Speed a Marker of Brain Vulnerability in Late Life? Digit Symbol Substitution Test in the Prediction of Alzheimer, Parkinson, Stroke, Disability, and Depression. Background: Dementia, stroke, depression, and disability are frequent in late life and are major causes of quality of life disruption and family burden. Even though each of these disorders relies on specific pathogenic processes, a common clinical manifestation is psychomotor slowing. Objective: We assessed the relevance of a simple marker of low psychomotor speed in predicting several brain outcomes: dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, depressive symptoms, and disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Methods: PAQUID is a population-based study involving 3,777 individuals aged 65 or older prospectively followed-up with repeated clinical evaluations. After 10 years, 437 participants developed dementia, 333 developed AD, 71 developed PD, 207 reported incident stroke, 404 developed disability in ADL, 994 in IADL, and 494 developed depressive symptomology. Psychomotor speed was measured with the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). Cox proportional hazards models controlled for several confounders assessed the risk of incident outcomes. Results: Participants with low DSST performance had increased risk of incident all-type dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 3.41, p < 0.0001) and AD-type dementia (HR 3.18, p < 0.0001). Higher risk for PD (HR 2.98, p = 0.04), IADL (HR 1.82, p < 0.0001), ADL disability (HR 1.95, p = 0.001), depressive symptoms (HR 1.53, p = 0.03), and a statistical trend for stroke (HR 1.88, p = 0.09) was also found. Conclusion: Low psychomotor speed is associated with an increased risk of developing various brain outcomes: dementia, AD, PD, disability, depressive symptoms, and marginally stroke. Low psychomotor speed may be the consequence of a number of discrete cerebral abnormalities and could be considered as a marker of brain vulnerability. In clinical practice, a low score in DSST should be seen as a warning sign of possible negative evolution.\", 'Differential control of cocaine self-administration by GABAergic and glutamatergic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) modulates numerous neurobehavioral processes and is therefore explored as a target for the treatment of several mental and neurological diseases. However, previous studies have investigated CB1 by targeting it globally, regardless of its two main neuronal localizations on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. In the context of cocaine addiction this lack of selectivity is critical since glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal transmission is involved in different aspects of the disease. To determine whether CB1 exerts different control on cocaine seeking according to its two main neuronal localizations, we used mutant mice with deleted CB1 in cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB1) or in forebrain GABAergic neurons (GABA-CB1). In Glu-CB1, gene deletion concerns the dorsal telencephalon, including neocortex, paleocortex, archicortex, hippocampal formation and the cortical portions of the amygdala. In GABA-CB1, it concerns several cortical and non-cortical areas including the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamic, and hypothalamic nuclei. We tested complementary components of cocaine self-administration, separating the influence of primary and conditioned effects. Mechanisms underlying each phenotype were explored using in vivo microdialysis and ex vivo electrophysiology. We show that CB1 expression in forebrain GABAergic neurons controls mouse sensitivity to cocaine, while CB1 expression in cortical glutamatergic neurons controls associative learning processes. In accordance, in the nucleus accumbens, GABA-CB1 receptors control cocaine-induced dopamine release and Glu-CB1 receptors control AMPAR/NMDAR ratio; a marker of synaptic plasticity. Our findings demonstrate a critical distinction of the altered balance of Glu-CB1 and GABA-CB1 activity that could participate in the vulnerability to cocaine abuse and addiction. Moreover, these novel insights advance our understanding of CB1 neuropathophysiology.', 'Absence of evidence for a causal link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy strain variant L-BSE and known forms of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in human PrP transgenic mice. Prions are proteinaceous pathogens responsible for subacute spongiform encephalopathies in animals and humans. The prions responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are zoonotic agents, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. The transfer of prions between species is limited by a species barrier, which is thought to reflect structural incompatibilities between the host cellular prion protein (PrPC) and the infecting pathological PrP assemblies (PrPSc) constituting the prion. A BSE strain variant, designated L-BSE and responsible for atypical, supposedly spontaneous forms of prion diseases in aged cattle, demonstrates zoonotic potential, as evidenced by its capacity to propagate more easily than classical BSE in transgenic mice expressing human PrPC and in nonhuman primates. In humanized mice, L-BSE propagates without any apparent species barrier and shares similar biochemical PrPSc signatures with the CJD subtype designated MM2-cortical, thus opening the possibility that certain CJD cases classified as sporadic may actually originate from L-type BSE cross-transmission. To address this issue, we compared the biological properties of L-BSE and those of a panel of CJD subtypes representative of the human prion strain diversity using standard strain-typing criteria in human PrP transgenic mice. We found no evidence that L-BSE causes a known form of sporadic CJD.', 'Strokes are possible complications of cannabinoids use. It is critically important to identify all factors that may play a role in the recent increase of the incidence of stroke among the young population. Considering the worldwide use of cannabinoids (cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids), the recent legalization of their consumption in some countries, and their supposed involvement in cardiovascular events, we evaluated their role in the occurrence of neurovascular complications among the young. Ninety-eight patients were described in the literature as having a cannabinoids-related stroke (85 after cannabis use and 13 after synthetic cannabinoids). The distribution by type of stroke was as follows: 4 patients with an undetermined type of stroke, 85 with an ischemic stroke and/or a transient ischemic attack, and 9 with a hemorrhagic stroke. The mean age of patients was 32.3\\xa0±\\xa011.8\\xa0years (range 15–63), and the majority of them were male with a sex ratio of 3.7:1. Cannabis was often smoked with tobacco in 66% of cases. Most of the patients with cannabinoids-related strokes were chronic cannabis users in 81% of cases, and for 18% of them, there was a recent increase of the amount of cannabis consumption during the days before the occurrence of stroke. Even if the prognosis of stroke was globally favorable in 46% of cases, with no or few sequelae, 5 patients died after the neurovascular event. One striking element reported in the majority of the reports was a temporal relationship between cannabinoids use, whether natural or synthetic, and the occurrence of stroke. However, a temporal correlation does not mean causation, and other factors may be involved. Cannabis may be considered as a risk factor of stroke until research shows evidence of an underlying mechanism that, alone or in association with others, contributes to the development of stroke. As of today, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction triggered by cannabinoids use may be a convincing mechanism of stroke in 27% of cases. Indeed, despite the widespread use of cannabinoids, the low frequency of neurovascular complications after their use may be due to a genetic predisposition to their neurovascular toxicity in some individuals. Further studies should focus on this point. More importantly however, this low frequency may be underestimated because the drug consumption may not be systematically researched, neither by questioning nor by laboratory screening. Besides this vascular role of cannabinoids in the occurrence of stroke, a cellular effect of cannabis on brain mitochondria was recently suggested in an experimental study. One of the mechanisms involved in young cannabis users with stroke may be the generation of reactive oxygen species leading to an oxidative stress, which is a known mechanism in stroke in humans. It is useful to inform the young population about the real potential risk of using cannabinoids. We suggest to systematically ask all young adults with stroke about their drug consumption including cannabinoids, to screen urine for cannabis or to include a specific diagnostic test to detect synthetic cannabinoids, and to obtain non-invasive intracranial arterial investigations (i.e. CT-angiography or cerebral MRA) in order to search for cerebral vasoconstriction. However, several questions remained unresolved and further research is still needed to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in young cannabinoids users with stroke. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Cannabinoids and Epilepsy”.', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like superoxide dismutase 1 proteinopathy is associated with neuronal loss in Parkinson’s disease brain. Neuronal loss in numerous neurodegenerative disorders has been linked to protein aggregation and oxidative stress. Emerging data regarding overlapping proteinopathy in traditionally distinct neurodegenerative diseases suggest that disease-modifying treatments targeting these pathological features may exhibit efficacy across multiple disorders. Here, we describe proteinopathy distinct from classic synucleinopathy, predominantly comprised of the anti-oxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), in the Parkinson’s disease brain. Significant expression of this pathology closely reflected the regional pattern of neuronal loss. The protein composition and non-amyloid macrostructure of these novel aggregates closely resembles that of neurotoxic SOD1 deposits in SOD1-associated familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Consistent with the hypothesis that deposition of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders reflects upstream dysfunction, we demonstrated that SOD1 in the Parkinson’s disease brain exhibits evidence of misfolding and metal deficiency, similar to that seen in mutant SOD1 in fALS. Our data suggest common mechanisms of toxic SOD1 aggregation in both disorders and a potential role for SOD1 dysfunction in neuronal loss in the Parkinson’s disease brain. This shared restricted proteinopathy highlights the potential translation of therapeutic approaches targeting SOD1 toxicity, already in clinical trials for ALS, into disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson’s disease.', 'Sex-dependent behavioral deficits and neuropathology in a maternal immune activation model of autism. Infections during gestation and the consequent maternal immune activation (MIA) increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders in infants and throughout life, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects three times more males than females and is mainly characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted interests. Consistent findings also indicate that ASD patients suffer from movement disorders, although these symptoms are not yet considered as diagnosis criteria. Here we used the double-stranded RNA analog polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) MIA animal model of ASD in mice and explored its effects in males and females on social and motor behavior. We then investigated brain areas implicated in controlling and coordinating movements, namely the nigro-striatal pathway, motor cortex and cerebellum. We show that male mice are more affected by this treatment than females as they show reduced social interactions as well as motor development and coordination deficits. Reduced numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum was found more widespread and within distinct lobules in males than in females. Moreover, a reduced number of neurons was found in the motor cortex of males only. These results suggest that females are better protected against developmental insults leading to ASD symptoms in mice. They also point to brain areas that may be targeted to better manage social and motor consequences of ASD.', 'ApoE-fragment/Aβ heteromers in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Identification of endogenous pathological amyloid β peptides (Aβ) forms in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is still unclear. In healthy brain, Aβ can associate with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) which is involved in its metabolism and clearance. In the brain of patients with AD, ApoE is cleaved and produces ApoE fragments. We studied the forms of Aβ and their interaction with the ApoE fragments in post-mortem brains from control and AD patients by western blots and co-immunoprecipitation. Three Aβ-containing peptides and three ApoE fragments were specifically found in the brain of AD patients. Co-immunoprecipitations showed that ApoE fragments and Aβ1–42 peptides are co-partners in heteromers of 18 and 16 kDa while ApoE-fragments and Aβ peptides of 12 kDa did not interact with each other. Formation of the 18 kDa ApoE-fragment/Aβ heteromers is specifically increased in ApoE4 carriers and is a strong brain marker of AD while 16 kDa ApoE-fragment/Aβ and Aβ 12 kDa correlate to memory deficit. These data show that in patients with AD, ApoE fragmentation generates peptides that trap Aβ in the brain. Inhibiting the fragmentation or targeting ApoE fragments could be exploited to define strategies to detect or reverse AD.', 'Lifespan Changes of the Human Brain In Alzheimer’s Disease. Brain imaging studies have shown that slow and progressive cerebral atrophy characterized the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Despite a large number of studies dedicated to AD, key questions about the lifespan evolution of AD biomarkers remain open. When does the AD model diverge from the normal aging model? What is the lifespan trajectory of imaging biomarkers for AD? How do the trajectories of biomarkers in AD differ from normal aging? To answer these questions, we proposed an innovative way by inferring brain structure model across the entire lifespan using a massive number of MRI (N = 4329). We compared the normal model based on 2944 control subjects with the pathological model based on 3262 patients (AD + Mild cognitive Impaired subjects) older than 55 years and controls younger than 55 years. Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD models from the normal aging trajectory before 40 years for the hippocampus, followed by the lateral ventricles and the amygdala around 40 years. Moreover, our lifespan model reveals the evolution of these biomarkers and suggests close abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala, whereas trajectory of ventricular enlargement appears to follow an inverted U-shape. Finally, our models indicate that medial temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular enlargement are two mid-life physiopathological events characterizing AD brain.', 'Interhemispheric distribution of amyloid and small vessel disease burden in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related intracerebral hemorrhage. Background and purpose: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating presentation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but the mechanisms leading from vascular amyloid deposition to ICH are not well known. Whether amyloid burden and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel disease (SVD) are increased in the ICH-affected hemisphere compared to the ICH-free hemisphere in patients with a symptomatic CAA-related ICH was investigated. Methods: Eighteen patients with CAA-related ICH and 18 controls with deep ICH who underwent brain MRI and amyloid positron emission tomography using 18F-florbetapir were prospectively enrolled. In each hemisphere amyloid uptake using the standardized uptake value ratio and the burden of MRI markers of SVD including cerebral microbleeds, chronic ICH, cortical superficial siderosis, white matter hyperintensities and lacunes were evaluated. Interhemispheric comparisons were assessed by non-parametric matched-pair tests within each patient group. Results: Amyloid burden was similarly distributed across the brain hemispheres in patients with CAA-related ICH (standardized uptake value ratio 1.11 vs. 1.12; P\\xa0=\\xa00.74). Cortical superficial siderosis tended to be more common in the ICH-affected hemisphere compared to the ICH-free hemisphere (61% vs. 33%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.063). Other MRI markers of SVD did not differ across brain hemispheres. In controls with deep ICH, no interhemispheric difference was observed either for amyloid burden or for MRI markers of SVD. Conclusions: Brain hemorrhage does not appear to be directly linked to amyloid burden in patients with CAA-related ICH. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms leading to hemorrhage in CAA.', 'Intracerebral synthesis of glutamine from hyperpolarized glutamate. Purpose: Changes in glutamate (Glu) levels occur in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. We proposed the use of 13C spectroscopy and the highly amplified signal generated by hyperpolarization to achieve spatial and temporal resolutions adequate for in vivo studies of Glu metabolism in the healthy rat brain. Thus, we investigated uptake of hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu after a temporary blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption protocol and its conversion to glutamine (Gln) in the brain. Methods: [1-13C]Glu was hyperpolarized using the dynamic nuclear polarization process. A temporary BBB disruption using mannitol allowed hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu to reach the brain. Then, hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu brain metabolism was observed in vivo by MR spectroscopy experiments at 3T. Products synthesized from [1-13C]Glu were assigned via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results: Hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu reached 20% ± 2.3% polarization after 90 min. After validation of the BBB disruption protocol, hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu (175.4 ppm) was detected inside the rat brain, and the formation of [1-13C]Gln at 174.9 ppm was also observed. Conclusion: The Gln synthesis from hyperpolarized [1-13C]Glu can be monitored in vivo in the healthy rat brain after opening the BBB.

', 'Stress exposure alters brain mRNA expression of the genes involved in insulin signalling, an effect modified by a high fat/ high fructose diet and cinnamon supplement. In occidental societies, high fat and high sugar diets often coincide with episodes of stress. The association is likely to modify brain energy control. Brain insulin signalling is rarely studied in stressed individuals consuming high fat diets. Furthermore the effects of cinnamon supplement are not known in these conditions. Therefore, we exposed rats, over a 12-week period, to a control (C) or a high fat/high fructose (HF/HFr) diet that induces peripheral insulin resistance. A cinnamon supplement (C+CN and HF/HFr +CN) was added or not. After diet exposure, one group of rats was exposed to a 30-min restraint followed by a 10-min open-field test, their combination featuring a moderate stressor, the other rats staying unstressed in their home cages. The insulin signalling in hippocampus and frontal cortex was studied through the mRNA expression of the following genes: insulin receptor (Ir), insulin receptor substrate (Irs1), glucose transporters (Glut1 and Glut3), glycogen synthase (Gys1) and their modulators, Akt1 and Pten. In C rats, stress enhanced the expression of Ir, Irs1, Glut1, Gys1 and Akt1 mRNA. In C+CN rats, stress induced an increase in Pten but a decrease in Gys1 mRNA expression. In HF/HFr rats, stress was associated with an increase in Pten mRNA expression. In HF/HFr+CN rats, stress increased Pten mRNA expression but also decreased Gys1 mRNA expression. This suggests that a single moderate stress favours energy refilling mechanisms, an effect blunted by a previous HF/HFr diet and cinnamon supplement.', \"From congenial paralysis to post-early brain injury developmental condition: Where does cerebral palsy actually stand?. Cerebral palsy (CP), an umbrella term for a developmental motor disorder caused by early brain injury (EBI)/interference, remains debated. In this essay, we present a narrative, beginning with the original anatomical-clinical description of the so-called paralysie congéniale (congenial paralysis) by the French psychiatrist Jean-Baptiste Cazauvieilh. We then discuss how the concept has evolved over the last 2 centuries. We aim to illustrate these ideas with the biopsychosocial model of health, especially in light of the current neuroscientific and sociological knowledge of human development. We endeavour to integrate 3 connected but distinct entities: (1) the EBI as a seminal turning point of the individual's story; (2) the clinical findings we call CP, when motor impairment and activity limitation related to post-EBI (or other early non-progressive brain interference) appears, and; (3) a post-EBI developmental condition that encompasses the overall consequences of an EBI. This framework should guide individual, familial and collective care discussions and research strategies beyond the scope of CP.\", \"Blood Flow as a Route for Bidirectional Propagation of Synucleinopathy in Parkinson's Disease?. \", 'Multicolor spectral photon counting CT monitors and quantifies therapeutic cells and their encapsulating scaffold in a model of brain damage. Rationale & aim: Various types of cell therapies are currently under investigation for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. To bridge the gap between cell administration and therapeutic outcome, there is a need for non-invasive monitoring of these innovative therapeutic approaches. Spectral photon counting computed tomography (SPCCT) is a new imaging modality that may be suitable for cell tracking. SPCCT is the next generation of clinical CT that allows the selective visualization and quantification of multiple contrast agents. The aims of this study are: (i) to demonstrate the feasibility of using SPCCT to longitudinally monitor and quantify therapeutic cells, i.e. bone marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages transplanted in rats with brain damage; and (ii) to evaluate the potential of this approach to discriminate M2-polarized macrophages from their encapsulating scaffold. Methods: Twenty one rats received an intralesional transplantation of bone marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages. In the first set of experiments, cells were labeled with gold nanoparticles and tracked for up to two weeks post-injection in a monocolor study via gold K-edge imaging. In the second set of experiments, the same protocol was repeated for a bicolor study, in which the labeled cells are embedded in iodine nanoparticle-labeled scaffold. The amount of gold in the brain was longitudinally quantified using gold K-edge images reconstructed from SPCCT acquisition. Animals were sacrificed at different time points post-injection, and ICP-OES was used to validate the accuracy of gold quantification from SPCCT imaging. Results: The feasibility of therapeutic cell tracking was successfully demonstrated in brain-damaged rats with SPCCT imaging. The imaging modality enabled cell monitoring for up to 2 weeks post-injection, in a specific and quantitative manner. Differentiation of labeled cells and their embedding scaffold was also feasible with SPCCT imaging, with a detection limit as low as 5,000 cells in a voxel of 250 × 250 × 250 µm in dimension in vivo. Conclusion: Multicolor SPCCT is an innovative translational imaging tool that allows monitoring and quantification of therapeutic cells and their encapsulating scaffold transplanted in the damaged rat brain.', 'A microPET comparison of the effects of etifoxine and diazepam on [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil uptake in rat brains. Using positron emission tomography (PET), the present study assessed the binding of [11C]flumazenil to GABA-A receptors in anesthetized rats following a single intravenous injection of an active dose of either etifoxine (25mg/kg) or diazepam (1mg/kg), which are both anxiolytic drugs. [11C]flumazenil binding was measured in five discrete brain structures, namely the caudate putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital cortex and parietal cortex. As expected, diazepam injection produced a significant decrease in [11C]flumazenil binding, which was interpreted as benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor occupancy, whereas etifoxine increased the binding of [11C]flumazenil. This first use of in vivo imaging after etifoxine administration revealed the activated binding pattern of [11C]flumazenil and highlighted the pharmacological differences between etifoxine and benzodiazepines. Using the same [11C]flumazenil radiotracer, PET neuroimaging could be applied to larger animals and, ultimately, to human subjects, thus providing new perspectives for better defining the molecular pharmacology of etifoxine.', 'Evolutionary signals of selection on cognition from the great tit genome and methylome. For over 50 years, the great tit (Parus major) has been a model species for research in evolutionary, ecological and behavioural research; in particular, learning and cognition have been intensively studied. Here, to provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms behind these important traits, we de novo assemble a great tit reference genome and whole-genome re-sequence another 29 individuals from across Europe. We show an overrepresentation of genes related to neuronal functions, learning and cognition in regions under positive selection, as well as increased CpG methylation in these regions. In addition, great tit neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns are very similar to those observed in mammals, suggesting a universal role in neuronal epigenetic regulation which can affect learning-, memory- and experience-induced plasticity. The high-quality great tit genome assembly will play an instrumental role in furthering the integration of ecological, evolutionary, behavioural and genomic approaches in this model species.', \"Impairment of Glycolysis-Derived L-Serine Production in Astrocytes Contributes to Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease. Alteration of brain aerobic glycolysis is often observed early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether and how such metabolic dysregulation contributes to both synaptic plasticity and behavioral deficits in AD is not known. Here, we show that the astrocytic L-serine biosynthesis pathway, which branches from glycolysis, is impaired in young AD mice and in AD patients. L-serine is the precursor of D-serine, a co-agonist of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) required for synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, AD mice display a lower occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist site as well as synaptic and behavioral deficits. Similar deficits are observed following inactivation of the L-serine synthetic pathway in hippocampal astrocytes, supporting the key role of astrocytic L-serine. Supplementation with L-serine in the diet prevents both synaptic and behavioral deficits in AD mice. Our findings reveal that astrocytic glycolysis controls cognitive functions and suggest oral L-serine as a ready-to-use therapy for AD.\", 'Measuring the electrophysiological effects of direct electrical stimulation after awake brain surgery. Objective. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) at 60 Hz is used to perform real-time functional mapping of the brain, and guide tumour resection during awake neurosurgery. Nonetheless, the electrophysiological effects of DES remain largely unknown, both locally and remotely. Approach. In this study, we lowered the DES frequency to 1-10 Hz and we used a differential recording mode of electro-corticographic (ECoG) signals to improve the focality with a simple algorithm to remove the artefacts due to the response of the acquisition chain. Main results. Doing so, we were able to observe different components in the evoked potentials triggered by simulating the cortex or the subcortical white matter pathways near the recording electrodes and by stimulating the cortex remotely from the recording site. More particularly, P0 and N1 components were repeatedly observed on raw ECoG signals without the need to average the data. Significance. This new methodology is important to probe the electrophysiological states and the connectivity of the brain in vivo and in real time, namely to perform electrophysiological brain mapping on human patients operated in the neurosurgical room and to better understand the electrophysiological spreading of DES.', 'Puzzling mosaics in cerebrospinal fluid. ', 'Imaging grafted cells with [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG using an optimized HSV1-TK mammalian expression vector in a brain injury rodent model. Introduction: Cell transplantation is an innovative therapeutic approach after brain injury to compensate for tissue damage. To have real-time longitudinal monitoring of intracerebrally grafted cells, we explored the feasibility of a molecular imaging approach using thymidine kinase HSV1-TK gene encoding and [18F]FHBG as a reporter probe to image enzyme expression. Methods: A stable neuronal cell line expressing HSV1-TK was developed with an optimised mammalian expression vector to ensure long-term transgene expression. After [18F]FHBG incubation under defined parameters, calibration ranges from 1 X 104 to 3 X 106 Neuro2A-TK cells were analysed by gamma counter or by PET-camera. In parallel, grafting with different quantities of [18F]FHBG prelabelled Neuro2A-TK cells was carried out in a rat brain injury model induced by stereotaxic injection of malonate toxin. Image acquisition of the rats was then performed with PET/CT camera to study the [18F]FHBG signal of transplanted cells in vivo. Results: Under the optimised incubation conditions, [18F]FHBG cell uptake rate was around 2.52%. In-vitro calibration range analysis shows a clear linear correlation between the number of cells and the signal intensity. The PET signal emitted into rat brain correlated well with the number of cells injected and the number of surviving grafted cells was recorded via the in-vitro calibration range. PET/CT acquisitions also allowed validation of the stereotaxic injection procedure. Technique sensitivity was evaluated under 5 X 104 grafted cells in vivo. No [18F]FHBG or [18F]metabolite release was observed showing a stable cell uptake even 2 h post-graft. Conclusion: The development of this kind of approach will allow grafting to be controlled and ensure longitudinal follow-up of cell viability and biodistribution after intracerebral injection.', 'Brain serotonin synthesis capacity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy and sertraline. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are both effective treatments for some patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), yet little is known about the neurochemical changes related to these treatment modalities. Here, we used positron emission tomography and the α-[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan tracer to examine the changes in brain regional serotonin synthesis capacity in OCD patients following treatment with CBT or SSRI treatment. Sixteen medication-free OCD patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either CBT or sertraline treatment. Pre-to-post treatment changes in the α-[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan brain trapping constant, K∗(ml/g/min), were assessed as a function of symptom response, and correlations with symptom improvement were examined. Responders/partial responders to treatment did not show significant changes in relative regional tracer uptake; rather, in responders/partial responders, 12 weeks of treatment led to serotonin synthesis capacity increases that were brain-wide. Irrespective of treatment modality, baseline serotonin synthesis capacity in the raphe nuclei correlated positively with clinical improvement. These observations suggest that, for some patients, successful remediation of OCD symptoms might be associated with greater serotonergic tone.', 'PET imaging for better understanding of normal and pathological neurotransmission. Positron emission tomography imaging is still an expanding field of preclinical and clinical investigations exploring the brain and its normal and pathological functions. In addition to technological improvements in PET scanners, the availability of suitable radiotracers for unexplored pharmacological targets is a key factor in this expansion. Many radiotracers (or radiopharmaceuticals, when administered to humans) have been developed by multidisciplinary teams to visualize and quantify a growing numbers of brain receptors, transporters, enzymes and other targets. The development of new PET radiotracers still represents an exciting challenge, given the large number of neurochemical functions that remain to be explored. In this article, we review the development context of the first preclinical radiotracers and their passage to humans. The main current contributions of PET radiotracers are described in terms of imaging neuronal metabolism, quantification of receptors and transporters, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory imaging. The different approaches to functional imaging of neurotransmission are also discussed. Finally, the contributions of PET imaging to the research and development of new brain drugs are described.', 'Molecular insights into sars-cov2-induced alterations of the gut/brain axis. For a yet unknown reason, a substantial share of patients suffering from COVID-19 develop long-lasting neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from cognitive deficits to mood disorders and/or an extreme fatigue. We previously reported that in non-neural cells, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the gene coding for the SARS-CoV2 host receptor, harbors tight co-expression links with dopa-decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of dopamine. Here, we mined and integrated data from distinct human expression atlases and found that, among a wide range of tissues and cells, enterocytes of the small intestine express the highest expression levels of ACE2, DDC and several key genes supporting the metabolism of neurotransmitters. Based on these results, we performed co-expression analyses on a recently published set of RNA-seq data obtained from SARS-CoV2-infected human intestinal organoids. We observed that in SARS-CoV2-infected enterocytes, ACE2 co-regulates not only with DDC but also with a specific group of genes involved in (i) the dopamine/trace amines metabolic pathway, (ii) the absorption of microbiota-derived L-DOPA and (iii) the absorption of neutral amino acids serving as precursors to neurotransmitters. We conclude that in patients with long COVID, a chronic infection and inflammation of small intestine enterocytes might be indirectly responsible for prolonged brain alterations.', \"In Silico, in Vitro, and in Vivo Evaluation of New Candidates for α-Synuclein PET Imaging. Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuropathological hallmark of synucleinopathies. To date, no selective α-syn positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer has been identified. Our objective was to develop the first original, selective, and specific α-syn PET radiotracer. Chemical design inspired from three structural families that demonstrated interesting α-syn binding characteristics was used as a starting point. Bioinformatics modeling of α-syn fibrils was then employed to select the best molecular candidates before their syntheses. An in vitro binding assay was performed to evaluate the affinity of the compounds. Radiotracer specificity and selectivity were assessed by in vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET studies in animal (rodents) models. Finally, gold standard in vitro autoradiography with patients' postmortem tissues was performed to confirm/infirm the α-syn binding characteristics. Two compounds exhibited a good brain availability and bound to α-syn and Aβ fibrils in a rat model. In contrast, no signal was observed in a mouse model of synucleinopathy. Experiments in human tissues confirmed these negative results.\", 'Cognitive changes of older adults with an equivocal amyloid load. Background: Observational and interventional studies addressing the link between amyloid (Aβ) burden and cognitive decline are increasing, but a clear definition of amyloid positivity is still lacking. This may represent a great stake for therapeutic studies enrolling Aβ + patients only. The main objective of this study was to define a population with “equivocal” amyloid status, and evaluate their cognitive changes. Methods: Sixty-five participants over 75\\xa0years old, from the Control group of the interventional MAPT study, at risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease, were included. Participants were classified into three groups in terms of amyloid load: Aβ +, Aβ\\xa0− and Equivocal participants (according to visual reading, global standardized uptake (SUVR) cut-offs, or a k-mean clustering method). The cognitive changes over time (memory, executive functions, attention and processing speed) of this Equivocal group were then compared to Aβ + and Aβ\\xa0− participants. Results: When classified by visual read, Equivocal participants’ memory scores were comparable to the Aβ- participants, and greater than in Aβ + participants over time. Secondary analyses, using SUVR cut-offs classification, showed different trajectories with Equivocal participants being comparable to the Aβ + participants, and lower than Aβ-, on executive performance over time. Conclusions: This original work pointed out a population that may be of great interest for interventional studies, raising the question of how amyloid status should be defined and integrated in such studies. These findings should be replicated in future studies on larger datasets, to confirm what methodological approach would be the most suitable to highlight this specific neuroimaging entity.', 'Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis in adult patients requiring intensive care. Rationale: Encephalitis caused by anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies is the leading cause of immune-mediated encephalitis. There are limited data on intensive care unit (ICU) management of these patients. Objectives: To identify prognostic factors of good neurologic outcome in patients admitted to an ICU with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Methods: This was an observational multicenter study of all consecutive adult patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis at the French National Reference Centre, admitted to an ICU between 2008 and 2014. The primary outcome was a good neurologic outcome at 6 months after ICU admission, defined by a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-seven patients were included from 52 ICUs. First-line immunotherapy consisted of steroids (n = 61/74; 82%), intravenous immunoglobulins (n = 71/74; 96%), and plasmapheresis (n = 17/74; 23%). Forty-five (61%) patients received second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or both). At 6 months, 57% of patients had a good neurologic outcome. Independent factors of good neurologic outcome were early (≤8 d after ICU admission) immunotherapy (odds ratio, 16.16; 95% confidence interval, 3.32-78.64; for combined first-line immunotherapy with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins vs. late immunotherapy), and a low white blood cell count on the first cerebrospinal examination (odds ratio, 9.83 for <5 vs. >50 cells/mm3; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-90.65). Presence of nonneurologic organ failures at ICU admission and occurrence of status epilepticus during ICU stay were not associated with neurologic outcome. Conclusions: The prognosis of adult patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis requiring intensive care is good, especially when immunotherapy is initiated early, advocating for prompt diagnosis and early aggressive treatment.', 'Melatonin levels in preterm and term infants and their mothers. The prevention of perinatal brain damage following preterm birth remains a public health priority. Melatonin has been shown to be a promising neuroprotectant in neonatal preclinical models of brain damage, but few studies have investigated melatonin secretion in newborns. We hypothesized that melatonin circulating levels would be lower in preterm compared to term infants. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study to assess melatonin, and 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (aMT6s) concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay. Among 209 neonates recruited, 110 were born before 34 gestational weeks (GW) and 99 born after 34 GW. Plasma melatonin concentrations, measured at birth and on Day 3 were below detectable levels (≤7 pg/mL) in 78% and 81%, respectively, of infants born before 34 GW compared to 57% and 34%, respectively, of infants born after 34 GW. The distribution of plasma melatonin concentrations was found to be correlated with gestational age at both time-points (p < 0.001). Median urine aMT6s concentrations were significantly lower in infants born before 34 GW, both on Day 1 (230 ng/L vs. 533 ng/L, p < 0.0001) and on Day 3 (197 ng/L vs. 359 ng/L, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, melatonin secretion appears very low in preterm infants, providing the rationale for testing supplemental melatonin as a neuroprotectant in clinical trials.', 'Role for the membrane estrogen receptor alpha in the sexual differentiation of the brain. Estrogens exert pleiotropic effects on multiple physiological and behavioral responses. Male and female sexual behavior in rodents constitutes some of the best-characterized responses activated by estrogens in adulthood and largely depend on ERα. Evidence exists that nucleus- and membrane-initiated estrogen signaling cooperate to orchestrate the activation of these behaviors both in short- and long-term. However, questions remain regarding the mechanism(s) and receptor(s) involved in the early brain programming during development to organize the circuits underlying sexually differentiated responses. Taking advantage of a mouse model harboring a mutation of the ERα palmitoylation site, which prevents membrane ERα signaling (mERα; ERα-C451A), this study investigated the role of mERα on the expression of male and female sexual behavior and neuronal populations that differ between sexes. The results revealed no genotype effect on the expression of female sexual behavior, while male sexual behavior was significantly reduced, but not abolished, in males homozygous for the mutation. Similarly, the number of kisspeptin- (Kp-ir) and calbindin-immunoreactive (Cb-ir) neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPv) and the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA), respectively, were not different between genotypes in females. In contrast, homozygous males showed increased numbers of Kp-ir and decreased numbers of Cb-ir neurons compared to wild-types, thus leading to an intermediate phenotype between females and wild-type males. Importantly, females neonatally treated with estrogens exhibited the same neurochemical phenotype as their corresponding genotype among males. Together, these data provide evidence that mERα is involved in the perinatal programming of the male brain.', 'Zapping 500 faces in less than 100 seconds: Evidence for extremely fast and sustained continuous visual search. A number of studies have shown human subjects’ impressive ability to detect faces in individual images, with saccade reaction times starting as fast as 100 ms after stimulus onset. Here, we report evidence that humans can rapidly and continuously saccade towards single faces embedded in different scenes at rates approaching 6 faces/scenes each second (including blinks and eye movement times). These observations are impressive, given that humans usually make no more than 2 to 5 saccades per second when searching a single scene with eye movements. Surprisingly, attempts to hide the faces by blending them into a large background scene had little effect on targeting rates, saccade reaction times, or targeting accuracy. Upright faces were found more quickly and more accurately than inverted faces; both with and without a cluttered background scene, and over a large range of eccentricities (4°–16°). The fastest subject in our study made continuous saccades to 500 small 3° upright faces at 4° eccentricities in only 96 seconds. The maximum face targeting rate ever achieved by any subject during any sequence of 7 faces during Experiment 3 for the no scene and upright face condition was 6.5 faces targeted/second. Our data provide evidence that the human visual system includes an ultra-rapid and continuous object localization system for upright faces. Furthermore, these observations indicate that continuous paradigms such as the one we have used can push humans to make remarkably fast reaction times that impose strong constraints and challenges on models of how, where, and when visual processing occurs in the human brain.', 'Metabolic NMR mapping with microgram tissue biopsy. This study explores the potential of profiling a microgram-scale soft tissue biopsy by NMR spectroscopy. The important elements of high resolution and high sensitivity for the spectral data are achieved through a unique probe, HR-μMAS, which allowed comprehensive profiling to be performed on microgram tissue for the first time under MAS conditions. Thorough spatially resolved metabolic maps were acquired across a coronal brain slice of rat C6 gliomas, which rendered the delineation of the tumor lesion. The results present a unique ex vivo NMR possibility to analyze tissue pathology that cannot be fully explored by the conventional approach, HR-MAS and in vivo MRS. Aside from the capability of analyzing a small localized region to track its specific metabolism, it could also offer the possibility to carry out longitudinal investigations on live animals due to the feasibility of minimally invasive tissue excision.', \"Reappearance of arteriovenous malformations after complete resection of ruptured arteriovenous malformations: True recurrence or false-negative early postoperative imaging result?. OBJECTIVE: Ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are often obliterated after emergency microsurgical treatment. However, some studies have reported AVM recurrence after the obliteration of ruptured AVMs. The authors report their experience with AVM recurrence after successful microsurgical treatment of ruptured AVMs. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical data of 139 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgery at the authors' institution for ruptured AVM between 2002 and 2012. Each patient underwent a conventional cerebral angiography examination immediately after the surgery. Subsequent follow-ups were performed with MR angiography after 6 months, and, if there was no indication of AVM recurrence, patients were followed up with conventional cerebral angiography between 1 and 2 years after the treatment; pediatric patients were followed up until age 18 years. Recurrence was defined as new radiological evidence of an AVM at the site of a ruptured AVM or a new hemorrhage in patients with angiographically documented AVM obliteration on postoperative angiograms. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients at the time of ruptured AVM diagnosis was 30.8 years (SD ± 5, range 4-69 years), and 44 of the patients were younger than 18 years (the mean age at diagnosis in this pediatric subgroup was 11.4 years [range 4-17.9 years]). Complete AVM obliteration after the initial microsurgery was observed in 123 patients (89.5%). Reappearance of an AVM was noted in 7 patients between 12 and 42 months after the treatment, and all of these patients were younger than 18 years. The recurrent AVM was located in an eloquent zone in 4 patients, and deep venous drainage was noted in 3 patients. Radiosurgery was performed in 6 of these patients, and 1 patient underwent another microsurgical procedure. The authors noted only one rebleeding due to an AVM recurrence during the latency period after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS The recurrence of an AVM is fairly rare and affects mostly pediatric patients. Therefore, especially in children, long-term angiographic follow-up is required to detect AVM recurrence or an AVM remnant. The authors stress the need for discussion involving a multidisciplinary neurosurgical team to decide on treatment in cases of any AVM recurrence or remnant.\", 'Development of GnRH neurons in humans: New insights from 3D-imaging of fetal brains.

Introduction: Decoding emotional information from faces and voices is crucial for efficient interpersonal communication. Emotional decoding deficits have been found in alcohol-dependence (ALC), particularly in crossmodal situations (with simultaneous stimulations from different modalities), but are still underexplored in Korsakoff syndrome (KS). The aim of this study is to determine whether the continuity hypothesis, postulating a gradual worsening of cognitive and brain impairments from ALC to KS, is valid for emotional crossmodal processing. Methods: Sixteen KS, 17 ALC and 19 matched healthy controls (CP) had to detect the emotion (anger or happiness) displayed by auditory, visual or crossmodal auditory-visual stimuli. Crossmodal stimuli were either emotionally congruent (leading to a facilitation effect, i.e. enhanced performance for crossmodal condition compared to unimodal ones) or incongruent (leading to an interference effect, i.e. decreased performance for crossmodal condition due to discordant information across modalities). Reaction times and accuracy were recorded. Results: Crossmodal integration for congruent information was dampened only in ALC, while both ALC and KS demonstrated, compared to CP, decreased performance for decoding emotional facial expressions in the incongruent condition. Conclusions: The crossmodal integration appears impaired in ALC but preserved in KS. Both alcohol-related disorders present an increased interference effect. These results show the interest of more ecological designs, using crossmodal stimuli, to explore emotional decoding in alcohol-related disorders. They also suggest that the continuum hypothesis cannot be generalised to emotional decoding abilities.', 'Comparison of classification methods for tissue outcome after ischaemic stroke. In acute ischaemic stroke, identifying brain tissue at high risk of infarction is important for clinical decision-making. This tissue may be identified with suitable classification methods from magnetic resonance imaging data. The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the performance of five popular classification methods (adaptive boosting, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forest and support vector machine) in identifying tissue at high risk of infarction on human voxel-based brain imaging data. The classification methods were used with eight MRI parameters, including diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging obtained in 55 patients. The five criteria used to assess the performance of the methods were the area under the receiver operating curve (AUCroc), the area under the precision–recall curve (AUCpr), sensitivity, specificity and the Dice coefficient. The methods performed equally in terms of sensitivity and specificity, while the results of AUCroc and the Dice coefficient were significantly better for adaptive boosting, logistic regression, artificial neural networks and random forest. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the performances of these five classification methods regarding AUCpr, which was the main comparison metric. Machine learning methods can provide valuable prognostic information using multimodal imaging data in acute ischaemic stroke, which in turn can assist in developing personalized treatment decision for clinicians after a thorough validation of methods with an independent data set.', \"The schizophrenic's chilhood. Pathology of adolescence and young adult, schizophrenia can begin in very rare cases during childhood. Two early clinical forms of the disorder have been identified by epidemiological studies: one beginning at the age of 15; the other around 9 years old; While many questions remain unsanswered about the neurobiological and environmental factors – common or distinct – of these two clinical phenotype, both are related to a profoun and lasting alteration of the neurocognitive development whose origin would clearly go back to infancy or to the antenal period. Here we will present a possible story back of schizophrenia in the light of the latest neuroscientific studies in imagery and genetics from adolescence to antenal period.\", 'Differential recordings of local field potential: A genuine tool to quantify functional connectivity. Local field potential (LFP) recording is a very useful electrophysiological method to study brain processes. However, this method is criticized for recording low frequency activity in a large area of extracellular space potentially contaminated by distal activity. Here, we theoretically and experimentally compare ground-referenced (RR) with differential recordings (DR). We analyze electrical activity in the rat cortex with these two methods. Compared with RR, DR reveals the importance of local phasic oscillatory activities and their coherence between cortical areas. Finally, we show that DR provides a more faithful assessment of functional connectivity caused by an increase in the signal to noise ratio, and of the delay in the propagation of information between two cortical structures.', 'Type I interferon and selective permissiveness of central nervous system to measles virus infection. ', 'Cognitive inhibition impairments in presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. Objective: To investigate cognitive inhibition in presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and its associated neuroanatomical correlates. Methods: Thirty-eight presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+, mean age 38.2±8.0 years) and 22 C9-controls from the PREV-DEMALS cohort were included in this study. They underwent a cognitive inhibition assessment with the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT; time to completion (part B-part A); error score in part B) as well as a 3D MRI. Results: C9+ individuals younger than 40 years had higher error scores (part B) but equivalent HSCT time to completion (part B-part A) compared to C9-individuals. C9+ individuals older than 40 years had both higher error scores and longer time to completion. HSCT time to completion significantly predicted the proximity to estimated clinical conversion from presymptomatic to symptomatic phase in C9+ individuals (based on the average age at onset of affected relatives in the family). Anatomically, we found that HSCT time to completion was associated with the integrity of the cerebellum. Conclusion: The HSCT represents a good marker of cognitive inhibition impairments in C9+ and of proximity to clinical conversion. This study also highlights the key role of the cerebellum in cognitive inhibition.', '[<sup>11</sup>C]PF-3274167 as a PET radiotracer of oxytocin receptors: Radiosynthesis and evaluation in rat brain. Introduction Oxytocin plays a major role in the regulation of social interactions in mammals by interacting with the oxytocin receptor (OTR) expressed in the brain. Furthermore, the oxytocin system appears as a possible therapeutic target in autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric troubles, justifying current pharmacological researches. Since no specific PET radioligand is currently available to image OTR in the brain, the aim of this study was to radiolabel the specific OTR antagonist PF-3274167 and to evaluate [11C]PF-3274167 as a potential PET tracer for OTR in rat brains. Methods [11C]PF-3274167 was prepared via the O-methylation of its desmethyl precursor with [11C]methyl iodide. The lipophilicity of the radioactive compound was evaluated by measuring the n-octanol-buffer partition coefficient (logD). Autoradiography experiments were performed on rat brain tissue to evaluate the in vitro distribution of the [11C]PF-3274167. MicroPET experiments were conducted with and without pre-injection of ciclosporin in order to evaluate the influence of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the brain uptake. Results [11C]PF-3274167 was synthesized with high radiochemical and chemical purities (> 95%) and good specific activity. The measured logD was 1.93. In vitro, [11C]PF-3274167 did not show any evidence of specific binding to OTR. PET imaging showed that [11C]PF-3274167 uptake in rat brain was very low in basal conditions but increased significantly after the administration of ciclosporin, suggesting that it is a substrate of the P-gp. In the ciclosporin-pre-injected rat, however, [11C]PF-3274167 distribution did not match with the known distribution of OTR in rats. Conclusion [11C]PF-3274167 is not a suitable tracer for imaging of OTR in rat brain, probably because of a too low affinity for this receptor in addition to a poor brain penetration.', \"Liver Transplantation in Wilson's Disease with Neurological Impairment: Evaluation in 4 Patients. Background: The aim of this work is to report our early experiences about the benefits of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of persistent neurological symptoms in Wilson's disease (WD) patients. Methods: We describe our findings in 4 WD patients with neurological impairment or symptoms treated by LT: 2 patients had transplants due to worsening of neurological symptoms despite long-term appropriate medical treatment. The other 2 required LT because of symptoms associated with liver failure. Patients were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale and the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The 4 patients experienced neurological improvement after LT. The pre-LT Rankin score of the 2 patients transplanted due to neurological impairment was 4 compared to 3 and 2, respectively, post LT. The pre-LT Rankin scores of the 2 WD cases transplanted because of hepatic failure were 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 0 in both cases post LT. UWDRS score improved in 2 cases and remained stable in 1 less severely impaired case. Brain MRI abnormalities proved partially reversible in 3 patients and remained stable for 1 patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that LT could be envisaged for neurologically impaired WD patients.\", 'Observing dyspnoea in others elicits dyspnoea, negative affect and brain responses. Dyspnoea is usually caused by diagnosable cardiorespiratory mechanisms. However, frequently dyspnoea relates only weakly or not at all to cardiorespiratory functioning, suggesting that additional neuropsychosocial processes contribute to its experience. We tested whether the mere observation of dyspnoea in others constitutes such a process and would elicit dyspnoea, negative affect and increased brain responses in the observer. In three studies, series of pictures and videos were presented, which either depicted persons suffering from dyspnoea or nondyspnoeic control stimuli. Self-reports of dyspnoea and affective state were obtained in all studies. Additionally, respiratory variables and brain responses during picture viewing (late positive potentials in electroencephalograms) were measured in one study. In all studies, dyspnoea-related pictures and videos elicited mild-to-moderate dyspnoea and increased negative affect compared to control stimuli. This was paralleled by increased late positive potentials for dyspnoea-related pictures while respiratory variables did not change. Moreover, increased dyspnoea correlated modestly with higher levels of empathy in observers. The present results demonstrate that observing dyspnoea in others elicits mild-to-moderate dyspnoea, negative affect, and increased brain responses in the absence of respiratory changes. This vicarious dyspnoea has clinical relevance, as it might increase suffering in the family and medical caregivers of dyspnoeic patients.', 'Maternal consumption of piceatannol: A nutritional neuroprotective strategy against hypoxia-ischemia in rat neonates. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) remains a major cause of perinatal mortality and chronic disability in newborns worldwide (1–6 for 1000 births) with a high risk of future motor, behavioral and neurological deficits. Keeping newborns under moderate hypothermia is the unique therapeutic approach but is not sufficiently successful as nearly 50% of infants do not respond to it. In a 7-day post-natal rat model of HI, we used pregnant and breastfeeding female nutritional supplementation with piceatannol (PIC), a polyphenol naturally found in berries, grapes and passion fruit, as a neuroprotective strategy. Maternal supplementation led to neuroprotection against neonate brain damage and reversed their sensorimotor deficits as well as cognitive impairments. Neuroprotection of per os maternal supplementation with PIC is a preventive strategy to counteract brain damage in pups induced by HI. This nutritional approach could easily be adopted as a preventive strategy in humans.', 'Affective, Social, and Informative Gestures Reproduction in Human Interaction: Hyperscanning and Brain Connectivity. Gestural communication characterizes daily individuals’ interactions in order to share information and to modify others’ behavior. Social neuroscience has investigated the neural bases which support recognizing of different gestures. The present research, through the use of the hyperscanning approach, that allows the simultaneously recording of the activity of two or more individuals involved in a joint action, aims to investigate the neural bases of gestural communication. Moreover, by using hyperscanning paradigm we explore the inter-brain connectivity between two inter-agents, the one who performed the gesture (encoder) and the one who received it (decoder), with functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the reproduction of affective, social and informative gestures with positive and negative valence. Result showed an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (O2Hb) and inter-brain connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for affective gestures, in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) for social gestures and the frontal eye fields (FEF) for informative gestures, for both encoder and decoder. Furthermore, it emerged that positive gestures activate more the left DLPFC, with an increase in inter-brain connectivity in DLPFC and SFG. The present study revealed the relevant function of the type and valence of gestures in affecting intra- and inter-brain connectivity.', 'Spatially-Resolved Top-down Proteomics Bridged to MALDI MS Imaging Reveals the Molecular Physiome of Brain Regions. Tissue spatially-resolved proteomics was performed on 3 brain regions, leading to the characterization of 123 reference proteins. Moreover, 8 alternative proteins from alternative open reading frames (AltORF) were identified. Some proteins display specific post-translational modification profiles or truncation linked to the brain regions and their functions. Systems biology analysis performed on the proteome identified in each region allowed to associate sub-networks with the functional physiology of each brain region. Back correlation of the proteins identified by spatially-resolved proteomics at a given tissue localization with the MALDI MS imaging data, was then performed. As an example, mapping of the distribution of the matrix metallopeptidase 3-cleaved C-terminal fragment of -synuclein (aa 95–140) identified its specific distribution along the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Taken together, we established the molecular physiome of 3 rat brain regions through reference and hidden proteome characterization.

Introduction The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its related disorders rely on clinical criteria. There is, however, a large clinical overlap between the different neurodegenerative diseases affecting cognition and, frequently, there are diagnostic uncertainties with atypical clinical presentations. Current clinical practices can now regularly use positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) molecular imaging to help resolve such uncertainties. The Neurology Group of the French Society of Nuclear Medicine and Federations of Memory, Resources and Research Centers have collaborated to establish clinical guidelines to determine which molecular imaging techniques to use when seeking a differential diagnosis between AD and other neurodegenerative disorders affecting cognition. State of knowledge According to the current medical literature, the potential usefulness of molecular imaging to address the typical clinical criteria in common forms of AD remains modest, as typical AD presentations rarely raise questions of differential diagnoses with other neurodegenerative disorders. However, molecular imaging could be of significant value in the diagnosis of atypical neurodegenerative disorders, including early onset, rapid cognitive decline, prominent non-amnestic presentations involving language, visuospatial, behavioral/executive and/or non-cognitive symptoms in AD, or prominent amnestic presentations in other non-AD dementias. Conclusion and perspective The clinical use of molecular imaging should be recommended for assessing cognitive disturbances particularly in patients with early clinical onset (before age 65) and atypical presentations. However, diagnostic tools should always be part of the global clinical approach, as an isolated positive result cannot adequately establish a diagnosis of any neurodegenerative disorder.\", 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at 7 T in the Rat Barrel Cortex During Whisker Activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the opportunity to measure cerebral metabolite contents in vivo and noninvasively. Thanks to technological developments over the last decade and the increase in magnetic field strength, it is now possible to obtain good resolution spectra in vivo in the rat brain. Neuroenergetics (i.e., the study of brain metabolism) and, especially, metabolic interactions between the different cell types have attracted more and more interest in recent years. Among these metabolic interactions, the existence of a lactate shuttle between neurons and astrocytes is still debated. It is, thus, of great interest to perform functional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in a rat model of brain activation and monitor lactate. However, the methyl lactate peak overlaps lipid resonance peaks and is difficult to quantify. The protocol described below allows metabolic and lactate fluctuations to be monitored in an activated brain area. Cerebral activation is obtained by whisker stimulation and 1H-MRS is performed in the corresponding activated barrel cortex, whose area is detected using blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI). All steps are fully described: the choice of anesthetics, coils, and sequences, achieving efficient whisker stimulation directly in the magnet, and data processing.', 'ETMR-like infantile cerebellar embryonal tumors in the extended morphologic spectrum of DICER1-related tumors.

Background Hair collar sign (HCS) and hair tuft of the scalp (HTS) are cutaneous signs of an underlying neuroectodermal defect, but most available data are based on case reports. Objective We sought to define the clinical spectrum of HCS and HTS, clarify the risk for underlying neurovascular anomalies, and provide imaging recommendations. Methods A 10-year multicenter retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of HCS and HTS in pediatric patients was performed. Results Of the 78 patients included in the study, 56 underwent cranial and brain imaging. Twenty-three of the 56 patients (41%) had abnormal findings, including the following: (1) cranial/bone defect (30.4%), with direct communication with the central nervous system in 28.6%; (2) venous malformations (25%); or (3) central nervous system abnormalities (12.5%). Meningeal heterotopia in 34.6% (9/26) was the most common neuroectodermal association. Sinus pericranii, paraganglioma, and combined nevus were also identified. Limitations The partial retrospective design and predominant recruitment from the dermatology department are limitations of this study. Conclusions Infants with HCS or HTS are at high risk for underlying neurovascular anomalies. Magnetic resonance imaging scans should be performed in order to refer the infant to the appropriate specialist for management.', \"Striking while the iron is hot: Iron metabolism and ferroptosis in neurodegeneration. Perturbations in iron homeostasis and iron accumulation feature in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Proteins such as α-synuclein, tau and amyloid precursor protein that are pathologically associated with neurodegeneration are involved in molecular crosstalk with iron homeostatic proteins. Quantitative susceptibility mapping, an MRI based non-invasive technique, offers proximal evaluations of iron load in regions of the brain and powerfully predicts cognitive decline. Further, small molecules that target elevated iron have shown promise against PD and AD in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Despite these strong links between altered iron homeostasis and neurodegeneration the molecular biology to describe the association between enhanced iron levels and neuron death, synaptic impairment and cognitive decline is ill defined. In this review we discuss the current understanding of brain iron homeostasis and how it may be perturbed under pathological conditions. Further, we explore the ramifications of a novel cell death pathway called ferroptosis that has provided a fresh impetus to the “metal hypothesis” of neurodegeneration. While lipid peroxidation plays a central role in the execution of this cell death modality the removal of iron through chelation or genetic modifications appears to extinguish the ferroptotic pathway. Conversely, tissues that harbour elevated iron may be predisposed to ferroptotic damage. These emerging findings are of relevance to neurodegeneration where ferroptotic signalling may offer new targets to mitigate cell death and dysfunction.\", 'Better Collaterals Are Independently Associated With Post-Thrombolysis Recanalization Before Thrombectomy. Background and Purpose - In acute stroke patients with large vessel occlusion, the goal of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is to achieve early recanalization (ER). Apart from occlusion site and thrombus length, predictors of early post-IVT recanalization are poorly known. Better collaterals might also facilitate ER, for instance, by improving delivery of the thrombolytic agent to both ends of the thrombus. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the hypothesis that good collaterals independently predict post-IVT recanalization before thrombectomy. Methods - Patients from the registries of 6 French stroke centers with the following criteria were included: (1) acute stroke with large vessel occlusion treated with IVT and referred for thrombectomy between May 2015 and March 2017; (2) pre-IVT brain magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging, T2∗, MR angiography, and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging; and (3) ER evaluated ≤3 hours from IVT start on either first angiographic run or noninvasive imaging. A collateral flow map derived from perfusion-weighted imaging source data was automatically generated, replicating a previously validated method. Thrombus length was measured on T2∗-based susceptibility vessel sign. Results - Of 224 eligible patients, 37 (16%) experienced ER. ER occurred in 10 of 83 (12%), 17 of 116 (15%), and 10 of 25 (40%) patients with poor/moderate, good, and excellent collaterals, respectively. In multivariable analysis, better collaterals were independently associated with ER (P=0.029), together with shorter thrombus (P<0.001) and more distal occlusion site (P=0.010). Conclusions - In our sample of patients with stroke imaged with perfusion-weighted imaging before IVT and intended for thrombectomy, better collaterals were independently associated with post-IVT recanalization, supporting our hypothesis. These findings strengthen the idea that advanced imaging may play a key role for personalized medicine in identifying patients with large vessel occlusion most likely to benefit from IVT in the thrombectomy era.', 'Aquaporin 4 distribution in the brain and its relevance for the radiological appearance of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease. Background and purpose: To determine the precise incidence of lesions at sites of high Aquaporin-4 expression (hAQP4) and their possible association with known neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) lesions patterns. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of brain and, when available, spinal cord MRI scans of 54 NMOSD patients recruited among the French NMOSD cohort was performed. Brain lesions were annotated as MS-like, non-specific, or evocative of NMOSD. The topography of hAQP4 was reassessed by human brain atlas. The incidence of lesions in hAQP4 and their association with lesions evocative of NMOSD was estimated. Results: Among those included (41/54 female, mean age: 45 years) 47/54 (87%) presented brain lesions. Twenty-six/47 (55%) had lesions in hAQP4. Thirty-two/54 patients (60%) had lesions considered evocative of NMOSD. The majority of them also presented lesions in hAQP4 (65%, 21/32). Patients with lesions in hAQP4 and lesions evocative of NMOSD demonstrated more extensive myelitis compared to the other patients (7 [6–10] versus 4 [3–5] vertebral segments, P = 0.009). Conclusion: The coexistence of lesions evocative of NMOSD and in hAQP4 is associated with significantly more extensive myelitis, and might have pathophysiological and clinical significance.', 'Four-repeat tauopathies. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein with versatile functions in the dynamic assembly of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Four-repeat (4R-) tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases defined by cytoplasmic inclusions predominantly composed of tau protein isoforms with four microtubule-binding domains. Progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease or glial globular tauopathy belong to the group of 4R-tauopathies. The present review provides an introduction in the current concept of 4R-tauopathies, including an overview of the neuropathological and clinical spectrum of these diseases. It describes the genetic and environmental etiological factors, as well as the contemporary knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms, including post-translational modifications, aggregation and fragmentation of tau, as well as the role of protein degradation mechanisms. Furthermore, current theories about disease propagation are discussed, involving different extracellular tau species and their cellular release and uptake mechanisms. Finally, molecular diagnostic tools for 4R-tauopathies, including tau-PET and fluid biomarkers, and investigational therapeutic strategies are presented. In summary, we report on 4R-tauopathies as overarching disease concept based on a shared pathophysiological concept, and highlight the challenges and opportunities on the way towards a causal therapy.', 'MRI features of demyelinating disease associated with anti-MOG antibodies in adults. The spectrum of Myelin Oligodendrocytes Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease constitutes a recently described challenging entity, referring to a relatively new spectrum of autoimmune disorders with antibodies against MOG predominantly involving the optic nerve and spinal cord. The purpose of this article is to describe MRI features of MOG-AD involvement in the optic nerves, spinal cord and the brain of adults.', 'Audiovisual integration as conflict resolution: The conflict of the McGurk illusion. There are two main behavioral expressions of multisensory integration (MSI) in speech; the perceptual enhancement produced by the sight of the congruent lip movements of the speaker, and the illusory sound perceived when a speech syllable is dubbed with incongruent lip movements, in the McGurk effect. These two models have been used very often to study MSI. Here, we contend that, unlike congruent audiovisually (AV) speech, the McGurk effect involves brain areas related to conflict detection and resolution. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure blood oxygen level dependent responses to AV speech syllables. We analyzed brain activity as a function of the nature of the stimuli—McGurk or non-McGurk—and the perceptual outcome regarding MSI—integrated or not integrated response—in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The results showed that, regardless of perceptual outcome, AV mismatch activated general-purpose conflict areas (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex) as well as specific AV speech conflict areas (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus), compared with AV matching stimuli. Moreover, these conflict areas showed stronger activation on trials where the McGurk illusion was perceived compared with non-illusory trials, despite the stimuli where physically identical. We conclude that the AV incongruence in McGurk stimuli triggers the activation of conflict processing areas and that the process of resolving the cross-modal conflict is critical for the McGurk illusion to arise.

Molecules were tagged on their primary amine function with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, but derivatized histamine and N-methyl-histamine exhibited poor stability in contrast to derivatized histidine. To overcome this limitation, an automated derivatization performed within the capillary electrophoresis instrument was optimized and quantitatively validated. The limits of detection were 50, 30, and 60 nmol/L for histidine, histamine, and N-methyl-histamine, respectively. This study reports, for the first time, the amounts of histamine and its related compounds in brain extracts from populations of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus fossarum, and shows that these amounts vary mainly according to population and season, but are not affected by an experimental electrical shock.', 'Characterizing Regularization Techniques for Spatial Filter Optimization in Oscillatory EEG Regression Problems: Guidelines Derived from Simulation and Real-World Data. We report on novel supervised algorithms for single-trial brain state decoding. Their reliability and robustness are essential to efficiently perform neurotechnological applications in closed-loop. When brain activity is assessed by multichannel recordings, spatial filters computed by the source power comodulation (SPoC) algorithm allow identifying oscillatory subspaces. They regress to a known continuous trial-wise variable reflecting, e.g. stimulus characteristics, cognitive processing or behavior. In small dataset scenarios, this supervised method tends to overfit to its training data as the involved recordings via electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram or local field potentials generally provide a low signal-to-noise ratio. To improve upon this, we propose and characterize three types of regularization techniques for SPoC: approaches using Tikhonov regularization (which requires model selection via cross-validation), combinations of Tikhonov regularization and covariance matrix normalization as well as strategies exploiting analytical covariance matrix shrinkage. All proposed techniques were evaluated both in a novel simulation framework and on real-world data. Based on the simulation findings, we saw our expectations fulfilled, that SPoC regularization generally reveals the largest benefit for small training sets and under severe label noise conditions. Relevant for practitioners, we derived operating ranges of regularization hyperparameters for cross-validation based approaches and offer open source code. Evaluating all methods additionally on real-world data, we observed an improved regression performance mainly for datasets from subjects with initially poor performance. With this proof-of-concept paper, we provided a generalizable regularization framework for SPoC which may serve as a starting point for implementing advanced techniques in the future.', 'Cerebrovascular lesions in mixed neurodegenerative dementia: A neuropathological and magnetic resonance study. Background: In elderly brains of demented patients, Alzheimer and Lewy body pathology (LBP) are frequently associated. Cortical microinfarcts (CoMIs) are more observed in Lewy body disease, even in the absence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The present neuropathological and 7.0-tesla MRI studies investigate whether CoMIs are also more frequent in mixed neurodegenerative dementia syndromes. Summary: Both examinations revealed that CoMIs are increased to different degrees in mixed dementia syndromes according to the severity of the LBP. They were mainly associated with a trend of older age and arterial hypertension in the patients with the most severe LBP. Messages: The increased number of CoMIs in mixed dementia syndromes with LBP is mainly due to the associated cerebrovascular pathology, even in the absence of CAA.', 'Mapping Spatiotemporal Microproteomics Landscape in Experimental Model of Traumatic Brain Injury Unveils a link to Parkinson’s Disease. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health concerns with no clinically-approved FDA drug available for therapeutic intervention. Several genomics and neuroproteomics studies have been employed to decipher the underlying pathological mechanisms involved that can serve as potential neurotherapeutic targets and unveil a possible underlying relation of TBI to other secondary neurological disorders. In this work, we present a novel high throughput systems biology approach using a spatially resolved microproteomics platform conducted on different brain regions in an experimental rat model of moderate of controlled cortical injury (CCI) at a temporal pattern postinjury (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 10 days). Mapping the spatiotemporal landscape of signature markers in TBI revealed an overexpression of major protein families known to be implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD) such as GPR158, HGMB1, synaptotagmin and glutamate decarboxylase in the ipsilateral substantia nigra. In silico bioinformatics docking experiments indicated the potential correlation between TBI and PD through alpha-synuclein. In an in vitro model, stimulation with palmitoylcarnitine triggered an inflammatory response in macrophages and a regeneration processes in astrocytes which also further confirmed the in vivo TBI proteomics data. Taken together, this is the first study to assess the microproteomics landscape in TBI, mainly in the substantia nigra, thus revealing a potential predisposition for PD or Parkinsonism post-TBI.', 'Spatio-temporal characterization of causal electrophysiological activity stimulated by single pulse focused ultrasound: An ex vivo study on hippocampal brain slices. Objective. The brain operates via generation, transmission and integration of neuronal signals and most neurological disorders are related to perturbation of these processes. Neurostimulation by focused ultrasound (FUS) is a promising technology with potential to rival other clinically used techniques for the investigation of brain function and treatment of numerous neurological diseases. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal aspects of causal electrophysiological signals directly stimulated by short, single pulses of FUS on ex vivo mouse hippocampal brain slices. Approach. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular neuronal activities both at the single neuron and neural networks scales. Hence, MEAs provide an excellent platform for characterization of electrical activity generated, modulated and transmitted in response to FUS exposure. In this study, a novel mixed FUS/MEA platform was designed for the spatio-temporal description of the causal responses generated by single 1.78 MHz FUS pulses in ex vivo mouse hippocampal brain slices. Main results. Our results show that FUS pulses can generate local field potentials (LFPs), sustained by synchronized neuronal post-synaptic potentials, and reproducing network activities. LFPs induced by FUS stimulation were found to be repeatable to consecutive FUS pulses though exhibiting a wide range of amplitudes (50-600 μV), durations (20-200 ms), and response delays (10-60 ms). Moreover, LFPs were spread across the hippocampal slice following single FUS pulses thus demonstrating that FUS may be capable of stimulating different neural structures within the hippocampus. Significance. Current knowledge on neurostimulation by ultrasound describes neuronal activity generated by trains of repetitive ultrasound pulses. This novel study details the causal neural responses produced by single-pulse FUS neurostimulation while illustrating the distribution and propagation properties of this neural activity along major neural pathways of the hippocampus.', 'AllSome Sequence Bloom Trees. The ubiquity of next-generation sequencing has transformed the size and nature of many databases, pushing the boundaries of current indexing and searching methods. One particular example is a database of 2652 human RNA-seq experiments uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Recently, Solomon and Kingsford proposed the Sequence Bloom Tree data structure and demonstrated how it can be used to accurately identify SRA samples that have a transcript of interest potentially expressed. In this article, we propose an improvement called the AllSome Sequence Bloom Tree. Results show that our new data structure significantly improves performance, reducing the tree construction time by 52.7% and query time by 39%-85%, with a price of upto 3 × memory consumption during queries. Notably, it can query a batch of 198,074 queries in <8 hours (compared with around 2 days previously) and a whole set of k-mers from a sequencing experiment (about 27 million k-mers) in <11 minutes.', 'KLB is associated with alcohol drinking, and its gene product β-Klotho is necessary for FGF21 regulation of alcohol preference. Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health problem worldwide. Although drinking habits are known to be inherited, few genes have been identified that are robustly linked to alcohol drinking. We conducted a genome-wide association metaanalysis and replication study among > 105,000 individuals of European ancestry and identified β-Klotho (KLB) as a locus associated with alcohol consumption (rs11940694; P = 9.2 × 10-12). β-Klotho is an obligate coreceptor for the hormone FGF21, which is secreted from the liver and implicated in macronutrient preference in humans. We show that brain-specific β-Klotho KO mice have an increased alcohol preference and that FGF21 inhibits alcohol drinking by acting on the brain. These data suggest that a liver-brain endocrine axis may play an important role in the regulation of alcohol drinking behavior and provide a unique pharmacologic target for reducing alcohol consumption.', 'Symbolic representation of numerosity by honeybees (Apis mellifera): Matching characters to small quantities. The assignment of a symbolic representation to a specific numerosity is a fundamental requirement for humans solving complex mathematical calculations used in diverse applications such as algebra, accounting, physics and everyday commerce. Here we show that honeybees are able to learn to match a sign to a numerosity, or a numerosity to a sign, and subsequently transfer this knowledge to novel numerosity stimuli changed in colour properties, shape and configuration. While honeybees learned the associations between two quantities (two; three) and two signs (N-shape; inverted T-shape), they failed at reversing their specific task of sign-to-numerosity matching to numerosity-to-sign matching and vice versa (i.e. a honeybee that learned to match a sign to a number of elements was not able to invert this learning to match the numerosity of elements to a sign). Thus, while bees could learn the association between a symbol and numerosity, it was linked to the specific task and bees could not spontaneously extrapolate the association to a novel, reversed task. Our study therefore reveals that the basic requirement for numerical symbolic representation can be fulfilled by an insect brain, suggesting that the absence of its spontaneous emergence in animals is not due to cognitive limitation.', 'Plasma Aβ <inf>42</inf> as a biomarker of prodromal Alzheimer\\'s disease progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment: Evidence from the PharmaCog/E-ADNI Study. It is an open issue whether blood biomarkers serve to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) or monitor its progression over time from prodromal stages. Here, we addressed this question starting from data of the European FP7 IMI-PharmaCog/E-ADNI longitudinal study in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients including biological, clinical, neuropsychological (e.g., ADAS-Cog13), neuroimaging, and electroencephalographic measures. PharmaCog/E-ADNI patients were classified as \"positive\" (i.e., \"prodromal AD\" n = 76) or \"negative\" (n = 52) based on a diagnostic cut-off of Aβ 42 /P-tau in cerebrospinal fluid as well as APOE ϵ 4 genotype. Blood was sampled at baseline and at two follow-ups (12 and 18 months), when plasma amyloid peptide 42 and 40 (Aβ 42 , Aβ 40) and apolipoprotein J (clusterin, CLU) were assessed. Linear Mixed Models found no significant differences in plasma molecules between the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) and \"negative\" groups at baseline. In contrast, plasma Aβ 42 showed a greater reduction over time in the prodromal AD than the \"negative\" aMCI group (p = 0.048), while CLU and Aβ 40 increased, but similarly in the two groups. Furthermore, plasma Aβ 42 correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 score both in aMCI patients as a whole and the prodromal AD group alone. Finally, CLU correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 only in the whole aMCI group, and no association with ADAS-Cog13 was found for Aβ 40. In conclusion, plasma Aβ 42 showed disease progression-related features in aMCI patients with prodromal AD.', \"Predicting and tracking short term disease progression in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease: Structural brain biomarkers. Background: Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers has been recommended as enrichment strategy for trials involving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Objective: To model a prodromal AD trial for identifying MRI structural biomarkers to improve subject selection and to be used as surrogate outcomes of disease progression. Methods: APOE ϵ4 specific CSF Aβ 42 /P-tau cut-offs were used to identify MCI with prodromal AD (Aβ 42 /P-tau positive) in the WP5-PharmaCog (E-ADNI) cohort. Linear mixed models were performed 1) with baseline structural biomarker, time, and biomarker×time interaction as factors to predict longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog13, 2) with Aβ 42 /P-tau status, time, and Aβ 42 /P-tau status×time interaction as factors to explain the longitudinal changes in MRI measures, and 3) to compute sample size estimation for a trial implemented with the selected biomarkers. Results: Only baseline lateral ventricle volume was able to identify a subgroup of prodromal AD patients who declined faster (interaction, p = 0.003). Lateral ventricle volume and medial temporal lobe measures were the biomarkers most sensitive to disease progression (interaction, p≤0.042). Enrichment through ventricular volume reduced the sample size that a clinical trial would require from 13 to 76%, depending on structural outcome variable. The biomarker needing the lowest sample size was the hippocampal subfield GC-ML-DG (granule cells of molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) (n = 82 per arm to demonstrate a 20% atrophy reduction). Conclusion: MRI structural biomarkers can enrich prodromal AD with fast progressors and significantly decrease group size in clinical trials of disease modifying drugs.\", 'PATCH trial: Explanatory analyses. ', 'Androgen and estrogen actions on male physical activity: A story beyond muscle. Physical inactivity is a pandemic that contributes to several chronic diseases and poses a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. The search for effective strategies to combat sedentary behavior has led to an intensification of the research efforts to unravel the biological substrate controlling activity. A wide body of preclinical evidence makes a strong case for sex steroids regulating physical activity in both genders, albeit the mechanisms implicated remain unclear. The beneficial effects of androgens on muscle as well as on other peripheral functions might play a role in favoring adaptation to exercise. Alternatively or in addition, sex steroids could act on specific brain circuitries to boost physical activity. This review critically discusses the evidence supporting a role for androgens and estrogens stimulating male physical activity, with special emphasis on the possible role of peripheral and/or central mechanisms. Finally, the potential translation of these findings to humans is briefly discussed.', \"Whole exome sequencing identifies mutations in 10% of patients with familial non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate in genes mutated in well-known syndromes. Background: Oral clefts, that is, clefts of the lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P), are the most common craniofacial birth defects with an approximate incidence of ∼1/700. To date, physicians stratify patients with oral clefts into either syndromic CL/P (syCL/P) or non-syndromic CL/P (nsCL/P) depending on whether the CL/P is associated with another anomaly or not. In general, patients with syCL/P follow Mendelian inheritance, while those with nsCL/P have a complex aetiology and, as such, do not adhere to Mendelian inheritance. Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 30 risk loci for nsCL/P, which could explain a small fraction of heritability. Methods: To identify variants causing nsCL/P, we conducted whole exome sequencing on 84 individuals with nsCL/P, drawn from multiplex families (n=46). Results: We identified rare damaging variants in four genes known to be mutated in syCL/P: TP63 (one family), TBX1 (one family), LRP6 (one family) and GRHL3 (two families), and clinical reassessment confirmed the isolated nature of their CL/P. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that patients with CL/P without cardinal signs of a syndrome may still carry a mutation in a gene linked to syCL/P. Rare coding and non-coding variants in syCL/P genes could in part explain the controversial question of 'missing heritability' for nsCL/P. Therefore, gene panels designed for diagnostic testing of syCL/P should be used for patients with nsCL/P, especially when there is at least third-degree family history. This would allow a more precise management, follow-up and genetic counselling. Moreover, stratified cohorts would allow hunting for genetic modifiers.\", 'Targeting α-synuclein for PD therapeutics: A pursuit on all fronts. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is characterized both by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy Bodies. These Lewy Bodies contain the aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) protein, which has been shown to be able to propagate from cell to cell and throughout different regions in the brain. Due to its central role in the pathology and the lack of a curative treatment for PD, an increasing number of studies have aimed at targeting this protein for therapeutics. Here, we reviewed and discussed the many different approaches that have been studied to inhibit α-syn accumulation via direct and indirect targeting. These analyses have led to the generation of multiple clinical trials that are either completed or currently active. These clinical trials and the current preclinical studies must still face obstacles ahead, but give hope of finding a therapy for PD with time.', 'Morphoarchitectural variation in South African fossil cercopithecoid endocasts. Despite the abundance of well-preserved crania and natural endocasts in the South African Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecoid record, which provide direct information relevant to the evolution of their endocranial characteristics, few studies have attempted to characterize patterns of external brain morphology in this highly successful primate Superfamily. The availability of non-destructive penetrating radiation imaging systems, together with recently developed computer-based analytical tools, allow for high resolution virtual imaging and modeling of the endocranial casts and thus disclose new perspectives in comparative paleoneurology. Here, we use X-ray microtomographic-based 3D virtual imaging and quantitative analyses to investigate the endocranial organization of 14 cercopithecoid specimens from the South African sites of Makapansgat, Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Taung. We present the first detailed comparative description of the external neuroanatomies that characterize these Plio-Pleistocene primates. Along with reconstruction of endocranial volumes, we combine a semi-automatic technique for extracting the neocortical sulcal pattern together with a landmark-free surface deformation method to investigate topographic differences in morphostructural organization. Besides providing and comparing for the first time endocranial volume estimates of extinct Plio-Pleistocene South African cercopithecoid taxa, we report additional information regarding the variation in the sulcal pattern of Theropithecus oswaldi subspecies, and notably of the central sulcus, and the neuroanatomical condition of the colobine taxon Cercopithecoides williamsi, suggested to be similar for some aspects to the papionin pattern, and discuss potential phylogenetic and taxonomic implications. Further research in virtual paleoneurology, applied to specimens from a wider geographic area, is needed to clarify the polarity, intensity, and timing of cortical surface evolution in cercopithecoid lineages.', 'Klüver &amp; Bucy syndrome: an investigation of social and affective cognition. Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS) leads to important behavioral symptoms and social maladaptation. Rarely described, no previous study has investigated its social and affective cognitive profile. We report the case of ASP, a patient who developed a complete KBS at 9\\xa0years that evolved into an incomplete KBS. Orbitofrontal and temporal damages were evidenced. While a classic neuropsychological assessment showed a preserved global functioning, an extensive evaluation of her social and affective cognition (reversal learning, decision-making, emotion recognition, theory of mind, creative thinking) showed remarkable deficits. The relevancy of such findings for the characterization KBS and the field of neuropsychology are discussed.', 'De novo microdeletions and point mutations affecting SOX2 in three individuals with intellectual disability but without major eye malformations. Loss-of-function mutations and deletions of the SOX2 gene are known to cause uni- and bilateral anophthalmia and microphthalmia as well as related disorders such as anophthalmia-esophageal-genital syndrome. Thus, anophthalmia/microphthalmia is the primary indication for targeted, “phenotype first” analyses of SOX2. However, SOX2 mutations are also associated with a wide range of non-ocular abnormalities, such as postnatal growth retardation, structural brain anomalies, hypogenitalism, and developmental delay. The present report describes three patients without anophthalmia/microphthalmia and loss-of-function mutations or microdeletions of SOX2 who had been investigated in a “genotype first” manner due to intellectual disability/developmental delay using whole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray analyses. This result prompted us to perform SOX2 Sanger sequencing in 192 developmental delay/intellectual disability patients without anophthalmia or microphthalmia. No additional SOX2 loss-of-function mutations were detected in this cohort, showing that SOX2 is clearly not a major cause of intellectual disability without anophthalmia/microphthalmia. In our three patients and four further, reported “genotype first” SOX2 microdeletion patients, anophthalmia/microphthalmia was present in less than half of the patients. Thus, SOX2 is another example of a gene whose clinical spectrum is broadened by the generation of “genotype first” findings using hypothesis-free, genome-wide methods. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'Genetic Investigation of Thyroid Hormone Receptor Function in the Developing and Adult Brain. Thyroid hormones exert a broad influence on brain development and function, which has been extensively studied over the years. Mouse genetics has brought an important contribution, allowing precise analysis of the interplay between TRα1 and TRβ1 nuclear receptors in neural cells. However, the exact contribution of each receptor, the possible intervention of nongenomic signaling, and the nature of the genetic program that is controlled by the receptors remain poorly understood.', 'Right temporoparietal junction underlies avoidance of moral transgression in autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a core difference in theory-of-mind (ToM) ability, which extends to alterations in moral judgment and decision-making. Although the function of the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), a key neural marker of ToM and morality, is known to be atypical in autistic individuals, the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying its specific changes in moral decision-making remain unclear. Here, we addressed this question by using a novel fMRI task together with computational modeling and representational similarity analysis (RSA). ASD participants and healthy control subjects (HCs) decided in public or private whether to incur a personal cost for funding a morally good cause (Good Context) or receive a personal gain for benefiting a morally bad cause (Bad Context). Compared with HC, individuals with ASD were much more likely to reject the opportunity to earn ill gotten money by supporting a bad cause than were HCs. Computational modeling revealed that this resulted from heavily weighing benefits for themselves and the bad cause, suggesting that ASD participants apply a rule of refusing to serve a bad cause because they evaluate the negative consequences of their actions more severely. Moreover, RSA revealed a reduced rTPJ representation of the information specific to moral contexts in ASD participants. Together, these findings indicate the contribution of rTPJ in representing information concerning moral rules and provide new insights for the neurobiological basis underpinning moral behaviors illustrated by a specific difference of rTPJ in ASD participants.', 'Stimulus-specific information is represented as local activity patterns across the brain. Modern neuroimaging represents three-dimensional brain activity, which varies across brain regions. It remains unknown whether activity of different brain regions has similar spatial organization to reflect similar cognitive processes. We developed a rotational cross-correlation method allowing a straightforward analysis of spatial activity patterns distributed across the brain in stimulation specific contrast images. Results of this method were verified using several statistical approaches on real and simulated random datasets. We found, for example, that the seed patterns in the fusiform face area were robustly correlated to brain regions involved in face-specific representations. These regions differed from the non-specific visual network meaning that activity structure in the brain is locally preserved in stimulus-specific regions. Our findings indicate spatially correlated perceptual representations in cerebral activity and suggest that the 3D coding of the processed information is organized using locally preserved activity patterns across the brain. More generally, our results demonstrate that information is represented and shared in the local spatial configurations of brain activity.', 'Neuroplasticity and the brain connectome: What can Jean Talairach\\'s reflections bring to modern psychosurgery?. Contrary to common psychosurgical practice in the 1950s, Dr. Jean Talairach had the intuition, based on clinical experience, that the brain connectome and neuroplasticity had a role to play in psychosurgery. Due to the remarkable progress of pharmacology at that time and to the technical limits of neurosurgery, these concepts were not put into practice. Currently, these concepts are being confirmed by modern techniques such as neuroimaging and computational neurosciences, and could pave the way for therapeutic innovation in psychiatry. Psychosurgery commonly uses a localizationist approach, based on the idea that a lesion to a specific area is responsible for a deficit opposite to its function. To psychosurgeons such as Walter Freeman, who performed extensive lesions causing apparently inevitable deficit, Talairach answered with clinical data: complex psychic functions cannot be described that simply, because the same lesion does not provoke the same deficit in different patients. Moreover, cognitive impairment did not always follow efficacious psychosurgery. Talairach suggested that selectively destructing part of a network could open the door to a new organization, and that early psychotherapy could encourage this psychoplasticity. Talairach did not have the opportunity to put these concepts into practice in psychiatric diseases because of the sudden availability of neuroleptics, but connectomics and neuroplasticity gave rise to major advances in intraparenchymal neurosurgery, from epilepsy to low-grade glioma. In psychiatry, alongside long-standing theories implicating focal lesions and diffuse pathological processes, neuroimaging techniques are currently being developed. In mentally healthy individuals, combining diffusion tensor imaging with functional MRI, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography allows the determination of a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain on many spatial scales, the so-called connectome. Ultimately, global neurocomputational models could predict physiological activity, behavior, and subjective feeling, and describe neuropsychiatric disorders. Connectomic studies comparing psychiatric patients with controls have already confirmed the early intuitions of Talairach. As a striking example, massive dysconnectivity has been found in schizophrenia, leading some authors to propose a \"dysconnection hypothesis.\" Alterations of the connectome have also been demonstrated in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. Furthermore, normalization of the functional dysconnectivity has been observed following clinical improvement in several therapeutic interventions, from psychotherapy to pharmacological treatments. Provided that mental disorders result from abnormal structural or functional wiring, targeted psychosurgery would require that one be able: 1) to identify the pathological network involved in a given patient; 2) to use neurostimulation to safely create a reversible and durable alteration, mimicking a lesion, in a network compatible with neuroplasticity; and 3) to predict which functional lesion would result in adapted neuronal plasticity and/or to guide neuronal plasticity to promote recovery. All these conditions, already suggested by Talairach, could now be achievable considering modern biomarkers and surgical progress.', 'Stability analysis of a steady state of a model describing Alzheimer’s disease and interactions with prion proteins. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neuro-degenerative disease affecting more than 46 million people worldwide in 2015. AD is in part caused by the accumulation of Aβ peptides inside the brain. These can aggregate to form insoluble oligomers or fibrils. Oligomers have the capacity to interact with neurons via membrane receptors such as prion proteins (PrP C ). This interaction leads PrP C to be misfolded in oligomeric prion proteins (PrP ol ), transmitting a death signal to neurons. In the present work, we aim to describe the dynamics of Aβ assemblies and the accumulation of toxic oligomeric species in the brain, by bringing together the fibrillation pathway of Aβ peptides in one hand, and in the other hand Aβ oligomerization process and their interaction with cellular prions, which has been reported to be involved in a cell-death signal transduction. The model is based on Becker–Döring equations for the polymerization process, with delayed differential equations accounting for structural rearrangement of the different reactants. We analyse the well-posedness of the model and show existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate that this model admits a non-trivial steady state, which is found to be globally stable thanks to a Lyapunov function. We finally present numerical simulations and discuss the impact of model parameters on the whole dynamics, which could constitute the main targets for pharmaceutical industry.', 'Acute emotional stress and high fat/high fructose diet modulate brain oxidative damage through NrF2 and uric acid in rats. Studies focusing on the interaction of dietary and acute emotional stress on oxidative stress in cortex frontal and in brain mitochondria are scarce. Dietary-induced insulin resistance, as observed in Western diets, has been associated with increased oxidative stress causing mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesized that acute emotional stress could be an aggravating factor by impacting redox status in cortex and brain mitochondria. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the combination of an insulin resistance inducing high-fat/high-fructose (HF/HFr) diet and acute emotional stress on brain oxidative stress in rats. We measured several oxidative stress parameters (carbonyls, FRAP, TBARS assays, GSH, GSSG, oxidized DNA, mRNA expression of redox proteins (Nrf2), and uric acid). The HF/HFr diet resulted in increased oxidative stress both in the brain mitochondria and in the frontal cortex and decreased expression of the Nrf2 gene. The emotional stress induced an oxidative response in plasma and in brain mitochondria of the control group. In the HF/HFr group it triggered an increase expression of the redox transcription factor Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes. This suggests an improvement of the redox stress tolerance in response to an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, a blunted oxidative effect on several markers was observed in plasma and brain of HF/HFr-stressed group. This was confirmed in a parallel study using lipopolysaccharide as a stress model. Beside the Nrf2 increase, the stress induced a stronger UA release in HF/HFr which could take a part in the redox stress.', 'MRI of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The diagnosis of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) typically associates various extrapyramidal and pyramidal features, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms with bilateral hypointensities in the globus pallidus on iron-sensitive magnetic resonance images, reflecting the alteration of iron homeostasis in this area. This article details the contribution of MRI in the diagnosis by summarizing and comparing MRI patterns of the various NBIA subtypes. RECENT FINDINGS: MRI almost always shows characteristic changes combining iron accumulation and additional neuroimaging abnormalities. Iron-sensitive MRI shows iron deposition in the basal ganglia, particularly in bilateral globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Other regions may be affected depending on the NBIA subtypes including the cerebellum and dentate nucleus, the midbrain, the striatum, the thalamus, and the cortex. Atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, corpus callosum and cortex, and white matter changes may be associated and worsen with disease duration. Iron deposition can be quantified using R2 or quantitative susceptibility mapping. SUMMARY: Recent MRI advances allow depicting differences between the various subtypes of NBIA, providing a useful analytical framework for clinicians. Standardization of protocols for image acquisition and analysis may help improving the detection of imaging changes associated with NBIA and the quantification of iron deposition.', 'Coupling Neuropeptide Levels to Structural Plasticity in Drosophila Clock Neurons. In Drosophila, core clock neurons display remarkable remodeling of their connectivity on a daily basis. In a new study, Herrero et al. investigate some of the mechanisms underlying structural plasticity and show that it relies on the activation of a novel cyclic gated nucleotide channel operating downstream of the PDFR signaling pathway.', 'Super-Resolution Imaging of the Extracellular Space in Living Brain Tissue. The extracellular space (ECS) of the brain has an extremely complex spatial organization, which has defied conventional light microscopy. Consequently, despite a marked interest in the physiological roles of brain ECS, its structure and dynamics remain largely inaccessible for experimenters. We combined 3D-STED microscopy and fluorescent labeling of the extracellular fluid to develop super-resolution shadow imaging (SUSHI) of brain ECS in living organotypic brain slices. SUSHI enables quantitative analysis of ECS structure and reveals dynamics on multiple scales in response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Because SUSHI produces sharp negative images of all cellular structures, it also enables unbiased imaging of unlabeled brain cells with respect to their anatomical context. Moreover, the extracellular labeling strategy greatly alleviates problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with traditional imaging approaches. As a straightforward variant of STED microscopy, SUSHI provides unprecedented access to the structure and dynamics of live brain ECS and neuropil. Live tissue super-resolution 3D-STED microscopy combined with fluorescence labeling of the interstitial fluid reveals the complex spatial organization of the extracellular space of the brain.', 'Detailed statistical analysis plan for the SafeBoosC III trial: A multinational randomised clinical trial assessing treatment guided by cerebral oxygenation monitoring versus treatment as usual in extremely preterm infants. Background: Infants born extremely preterm are at high risk of dying or suffering from severe brain injuries. Treatment guided by monitoring of cerebral oxygenation may reduce the risk of death and neurologic complications. The SafeBoosC III trial evaluates the effects of treatment guided by cerebral oxygenation monitoring versus treatment as usual. This article describes the detailed statistical analysis plan for the main publication, with the aim to prevent outcome reporting bias and data-driven analyses. Methods/design: The SafeBoosC III trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, multinational, pragmatic phase III trial with a parallel group structure, designed to investigate the benefits and harms of treatment based on cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring compared with treatment as usual. Randomisation will be 1:1 stratified for neonatal intensive care unit and gestational age (lower gestational age (< 26 weeks) compared to higher gestational age (≥ 26 weeks)). The primary outcome is a composite of death or severe brain injury at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Primary analysis will be made on the intention-to-treat population for all outcomes, using mixed-model logistic regression adjusting for stratification variables. In the primary analysis, the twin intra-class correlation coefficient will not be considered. However, we will perform sensitivity analyses to address this. Our simulation study suggests that the inclusion of multiple births is unlikely to significantly affect our assessment of intervention effects, and therefore we have chosen the analysis where the twin intra-class correlation coefficient will not be considered as the primary analysis. Discussion: In line with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, we have developed and published this statistical analysis plan for the SafeBoosC III trial, prior to any data analysis.

The brain reuses neural processes initially devoted to mapping touch on the body.\", \"Kin recognition: Neurogenomic response to mate choice and sib mating avoidance in a parasitic wasp. Sib mating increases homozygosity, which therefore increases the risk of inbreeding depression. Selective pressures have favoured the evolution of kin recognition and avoidance of sib mating in numerous species, including the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We studied the female neurogenomic response associated with sib mating avoidance after females were exposed to courtship displays by i) unrelated males or ii) related males or iii) no courtship (controls). First, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship displays to those exposed to controls, we saw a rapid and extensive transcriptional shift consistent with social environment. Second, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship by related to those exposed to unrelated males, we characterized distinct and repeatable transcriptomic patterns that correlated with the relatedness of the courting male. Network analysis revealed 3 modules of specific 'sibresponsive' genes that were distinct from other 'courtship-responsive' modules. Therefore, specific neurogenomic states with characteristic brain transcriptomes associated with different behavioural responses affect sib mating avoidance behaviour.\", 'A new MRI marker of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. Purpose: Evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of disappearance of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) dentate nuclei (DN) hypointensity in oculomotor apraxia patients (AOA). Method: In this prospective study, 27 patients with autosomal genetic ataxia (AOA (n = 11), Friedreich ataxia and ataxia with vitamin E deficit (n = 4), and dominant genetic ataxia (n = 12)) were included along with fifteen healthy controls. MRIs were qualitatively classified for the presence or absence of DN hypointensity on FLAIR and SWI sequences. The MRIs were then quantitatively studied, with measurement of a ratio of DN over brainstem white matter signal intensity through manual delineation. The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained. In the cross-sectional analysis, the Mann–Whitney test was applied. Results: Qualitatively, the eleven AOA patients presented absence of both DN SWI and FLAIR hyposignals; three dominant genetic ataxia patients had moderate SWI DN hyposignal and absent FLAIR hyposignal; the thirteen remaining subjects presented normal SWI and FLAIR DN hyposignal. Absence of DN SWI hypointensity was 100% sensitive and specific to AOA. Quantitative signal intensity ratio (mean ± standard deviation) of the AOA group (98·96 ± 5·37%) was significantly higher than in control subjects group (76.40 ± 8.34%; p < 0.001), dominant genetic ataxia group (81·15 ± 9·94%; p < 0·001), and Friedreich ataxia and ataxia with vitamin E deficit group (87·56 ± 2·78%; p < 0·02). Conclusion: This small study shows that loss of the normal hypointensity in the dentate nucleus on both SWI and FLAIR imaging at 3 T is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for AOA.', 'How occupational status influences the processing of faces: An EEG study. This study examines the influence of social hierarchy on the neural electrophysiological responses to faces. In contrast with earlier EEG studies that typically manipulate social rank through competitive situations, we implemented hierarchy through occupational status and thus contrasted faces associated with high- vs. low-status (e.g. lawyer vs. waiter). Since social hierarchies are largely intertwined with gender, both female and male faces were used as stimuli, and both female and male participants were tested. The procedure consisted in presenting a status label before the face it was associated with. The analyses focused mainly on two components that have been shown to be modulated by competitive hierarchies and other social contexts, namely the N170 and the Late Positive Potential (LPP). The results indicated that gender, but not status, modulated the N170 amplitude. Moreover, high-status faces elicited larger LPP amplitude than low-status faces but this difference was driven by female participants. This gender effect is discussed in line with research showing that women and men are sensitive to different kinds of hierarchy. Methodological differences are considered to account for the discrepancy between studies that find an effect of hierarchy on the N170 and those that do not.', 'Widespread transcriptional disruption of the microRNA biogenesis machinery in brain and peripheral tissues of individuals with schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, altered transcription in brain and peripheral tissues may be due to altered expression of the microRNA biogenesis machinery genes. In this study, we explore the expression of these genes both at the cerebral and peripheral levels. We used shinyGEO application to analyze gene expression from ten Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, in order to perform differential expression analyses for eight genes encoding the microRNA biogenesis machinery. First, we compared expression of the candidate genes between control subjects and individuals with schizophrenia in postmortem cerebral samples from seven different brain regions. Then, we compared the expression of the candidate genes between control subjects and individuals with schizophrenia in three peripheral tissues. In brain and peripheral tissues of individuals with schizophrenia, we report distinct altered expression patterns of the microRNA biogenesis machinery genes. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, associative striatum and cerebellum of individuals with schizophrenia, we observed an overexpression pattern of some candidate genes suggesting a heightened miRNA production in these brain regions. Additionally, mixed transcriptional abnormalities were identified in the hippocampus. Moreover, in the blood and olfactory epithelium of individuals with schizophrenia, we observed distinct aberrant transcription patterns of the candidate genes. Remarkably, in individuals with schizophrenia, we report DICER1 overexpression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum as well as a congruent DICER1 upregulation in the blood compartment suggesting that it may represent a peripheral marker. Transcriptional disruption of the miRNA biogenesis machinery may contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis both in brain and peripheral tissues.', 'Understanding flow patterns and inflammatory status in intracranial aneurysms: Towards a personalized medicine. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are frequently and incidentally discovered with noninvasive imaging and the decision for preventive treatment is supported by epidemiologic and statistics data, lacking personalized argumentation about individual aneurysm behavior and inflammatory status of its wall. After a review of hemodynamic forces leading to aneurysm genesis and interaction with inflammation onset within aneurysmal wall, we will successively detail routine imaging methods for the aneurysmal wall and their respective contribution. Then, we will draw up the inventory of different experimental imaging and in vitro methods for future investigation of the aneurysmal wall. We emphasize the need for cooperation with various specialties: histopathology, genetics, and immunology in order to understand the natural history of the aneurysmal sac leading most often to stability but elsewhere to aneurysmal growth, thrombosis or rupture. A description of a research protocol devoted to aneurysmal wall inflammation and recently accepted in our university is introduced.', 'Morphological and Age-Related Changes in the Narcolepsy Brain. Morphological changes in the cortex of narcolepsy patients were investigated by surface-based morphometry analysis in this study. Fifty-one type 1 narcolepsy patients and 60 demographically group-matched healthy controls provided resting-state functional and high-resolution 3T anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans. Vertex-level cortical thickness (CT), gyrification, and voxel-wise functional connectivity were calculated. Adolescent narcolepsy patients showed decreased CT in bilateral frontal cortex and left precuneus. Adolescent narcolepsy demonstrated increased gyrification in left occipital lobe, left precuneus, and right fusiform but decreased gyrification in left postcentral gyrus, whereas adult narcolepsy exhibited increased gyrification in left temporal lobe and right frontal cortex. Furthermore, sleepiness severity was associated with altered CT and gyrification. Increased gyrification was associated with reduced long-range functional connectivity. In adolescent patients, those with more severe sleepiness showed increased right postcentral gyrification. Decreased frontal and occipital gyrification was found in cases with hallucination. In adult patients, a wide range of regions showed reduced gyrification in those with adolescence-onset compared adult-onset narcolepsy patients. Particularly the frontal lobes showed altered brain morphology, being a thinner cortex and more gyri. The impact of narcolepsy on age-related brain morphological changes may remain from adolescence to young adulthood, and it was especially exacerbated in adolescence.', 'Spatiotemporal characterization of brain infarction by sequential multimodal MR imaging following transient focal ischemia in a Rat model of intra-arterial middle cerebral artery occlusion. Objectives: To assess spatiotemporal brain infarction evolution by sequential multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in an endovascular model of acute stroke in rats. Materials and methods: A microwire was selectively placed in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 16 consecutives rats during 90\\xa0minutes occlusion. Longitudinal 7-T MR imaging, including angiography, diffusion, and perfusion was performed during ischemia, immediately after reperfusion, 3\\xa0h and 24\\xa0h after subsequent reperfusion. Results: MCA occlusion was complete in 75\\xa0% and partial in 18.7\\xa0%. Hypoperfusion (mean ± SD) was observed in all animals during ischemia (-59 ± 18\\xa0% of contralateral hemisphere, area 31 ± 5\\xa0mm2). Infarction volume (mean ± SD) was 90 ± 64\\xa0mm3 during ischemia and 57 ± 67\\xa0mm3 at 24\\xa0h. Brain infarction was fronto-parietal cortical in five animals (31\\xa0%), striatal in four animals (25\\xa0%), and cortico-striatal in seven animals (44\\xa0%) at 24\\xa0h. All rats survived at 24\\xa0h. Conclusion: This model is suitable to neuroprotection studies because of possible acute and close characterization of spatiotemporal evolution of brain infarction by MR imaging techniques, and evidence of ischemic penumbra, the target of neuroprotection agents. However, optimization of the brain infarct reproducibility needs further technical and neurointerventional tools improvements. Key points: • Nitinol microwire is MRI compatible allowing spatiotemporal characterization of brain infarction in rats. • Microwire selective placement in middle cerebral artery allows complete artery occlusion in 75 %. • A diffusion/perfusion mismatch during arterial occlusion is observed in 77 % of rats.', 'Differential effects of forward and backward masks on the relationship between perception and action. A recent series of experiments has shown that the effects of near-threshold stimuli on perceptual and motor responses are highly dependent on experimental conditions. In particular, motor influences of near-threshold distractors were observed when using low-contrast unmasked stimuli and high-contrast masked stimuli although only the latter affected motor responses in the absence of stimulus awareness. These results are compatible with neurophysiological models of visual masking, suggesting that early neural responses to a visual stimulus can be decomposed in feedforward activations to-and feedback activations from-higher visual areas, correlating respectively with the actual presence of the stimulus and its conscious perception. We tested the compatibility between these neurophysiological models and the behavioural data obtained in near-threshold experiments. We recorded fast reaching movements directed to a highly visible target followed by a report of the presence of a near-threshold distractor presented either at low contrast without mask or at high contrast with a backward or forward mask. Analysis of hand trajectories revealed that deviations toward the distractor were observed in the no-mask condition when the distractor was present and reported, and when it was present but not reported in the backward and forward mask conditions, although the effect was weaker in the latter condition. These data reveal that the presence or absence of perception-action dissociations in behavioural studies are well accounted for by neurophysiological models of visual masking and that behavioural effects of near-threshold distractors cannot result merely from on a dichotomic visual system for perception and action.', 'Punctate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancing lesions in the brain: a practical approach. Introduction: Cerebral punctate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancements (PCGE) correspond to opacification of small vessel lumen or its perivascular areas in case of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We will discuss the possible causes of intra-parenchymal central nervous system PCGE. Methods: Our review is based on French database including patients presenting with central nervous system PCGE and literature search using PubMed database with the following keywords: punctate enhancement, linear enhancement, and curvilinear enhancement. Disorders which displayed linear leptomeningeal or periventricular enhancements without intra-parenchymal PCGE are excluded of this review. Results: Among our 39 patients with PCGE, 16 different diagnoses were established. After combining our PCGE causes with those described in the literature, we propose a practical approach. Besides physiologic post-contrast enhancement of small vessels, three pathologic conditions may exhibit PCGE: (1) small collateral artery network seen in Moyamoya syndrome, (2) small veins congestions related to developmental or acquired venous outflow disturbance, and (3) disorders causing small vessels BBB disruption indicated by T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the corresponding areas of PCGE. Disruption of the BBB could be caused by a direct injury of the endothelial cell, as in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Susac syndrome, and radiochemotherapy-induced injuries, or by an angiocentric cellular infiltrate, as in inflammatory disorders, demyelinating diseases, host immune responses fighting against infections, prelymphoma states, lymphoma, and in CLIPPERS. Conclusion: PCGE may conceal several causes, including physiological and pathological conditions. Nevertheless, a practical approach could improve its management and limit the indications of brain biopsy to very specific situations.', 'Memory suppression in Alzheimer’s disease. An important challenge for memory is the competition between appropriate and inappropriate information during retrieval. This competition is normally reduced thanks to controlled inhibitory processes that suppress irrelevant memories. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compromise of suppression ability may result in strong competition between relevant and irrelevant memories during retrieval. The present review highlights this issue by examining studies using the directed forgetting method in AD. This method in which participants are typically instructed to forget no longer relevant information is argued to reflect suppression in memory. Studies using the directed forgetting method suggest that AD participants experience difficulties when they are asked to suppress no longer relevant information in working, autobiographical, source and destination memory. Difficulties in suppressing irrelevant information, as may be observed in AD, may hamper memory retrieval by activating irrelevant memories at the expense of relevant ones.', 'Glutamatergic postsynaptic density in early life stress programming: Topographic gene expression of mGlu5 receptors and Homer proteins. Type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu5) have been implicated in the mechanism of resilience to stress. They form part of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a thickening of the glutamatergic synapse that acts as a multimodal hub for multiple cellular signaling. Perinatal stress in rats triggers alterations that make adult offspring less resilient to stress. In the present study, we examined the expression of gene encoding the mGlu5 (Grm5), as well as those encoding the short and long isoforms of Homer proteins in different brain regions of the offspring of dams exposed to repeated episodes of restraint stress during pregnancy (“perinatally stressed” or PRS offspring). To this end, we investigated unconditioned behavioral response using the light/dark box test, as well as the expression of PSD genes (Homer1a, Homer1b, and Grm5), in the medial prefrontal cortex, cortex, caudate-putamen, amygdala, and dorsal hippocampus. PRS rats spent significantly less time in the light area than the control group. In the amygdala, Homer1a mRNA levels were significantly increased in PRS rats, whereas Homer1b and Grm5 mRNA levels were reduced. In contrast, the transcript encoding for Homer1a was significantly reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, and dorsal hippocampus of PRS rats. We also evaluated the relative ratio between Homer1a and Homer1b/Grm5 expression, finding a significant shift toward the expression of Homer1a in the amygdala and toward Homer1b/Grm5 in the other brain regions. These topographic patterns of Homer1a, Homer1b, and mGlu5 gene expression were significantly correlated with risk-taking behavior measured in the light/dark box test. Remarkably, in the amygdala and in other brain regions, Homer1b and Grm5 expression showed positive correlation with time spent in the light box, whereas Homer1a in the amygdala showed a negative correlation with risk-taking behavior, in contrast with all other brain regions analyzed, wherein these correlations were positive. These results suggest that perinatal stress programs the developmental expression of PSD molecules involved in mGlu5 signaling in discrete brain regions, with a predominant role for the amygdala.', 'Intracerebral Gene Therapy in Four Children with Sanfilippo B Syndrome: 5.5-Year Follow-Up Results. We report the safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy (secondary endpoint) of a novel intracerebral gene therapy at 5.5 years of follow-up in children with Sanfilippo B. An uncontrolled, phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in four patients aged 20, 26, 30, and 53 months. Treatment consisted of 16 intracerebral and cerebellar deposits of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector encoding human α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (rAAV2/5-hNAGLU) plus immunosuppression. An intermediate report at 30 months was previously published. Thirty treatment-emergent adverse events were reported between 30 and 66 months after surgery, including three classified as severe with no serious drug reactions. At 5.5 years, NAGLU activity was persistently detected in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (18% of unaffected control level). Circulating T cells reacting against NAGLU peptides were present, indicating a lack of acquired tolerance. Patients 2, 3, and 4 showed progressive brain atrophy and neurocognitive evolution that did not differ from untreated Sanfilippo A/B children. Patient 1, enrolled at 20 months of age, had a milder disease with normal brain imaging and a significantly better cognitive outcome than the three other patients and untreated patients, although not equivalent to normal children. After 5.5 years, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved with a good safety profile of the proposed treatment. We have also observed sustained enzyme production in the brain and absence of immunological tolerance. Cognitive benefit was not confirmed in the three oldest patients. Milder disease in the youngest patient supports further investigations of adeno-associated vector-mediated intracerebral gene therapy in Sanfilippo B.', \"Classifying EEG Signals during Stereoscopic Visualization to Estimate Visual Comfort. With stereoscopic displays a sensation of depth that is too strong could impede visual comfort and may result in fatigue or pain. We used Electroencephalography (EEG) to develop a novel brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual strain. We present the first system that discriminates comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using EEG. In particular, we show that either changes in event-related potentials' (ERPs) amplitudes or changes in EEG oscillations power following stereoscopic objects presentation can be used to estimate visual comfort. Our system reacts within 1 s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average (up to 76%) and 74% on average when 7 consecutive variations are measured (up to 93%). Performances are stable (≈62.5%) when a simplified signal processing is used to simulate online analyses or when the number of EEG channels is lessened. This study could lead to adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and viewing conditions. For example, it could be possible to match the stereoscopic effect with users' state by modifying the overlap of left and right images according to the classifier output.\", 'Normal ageing of the brain: Histological and biological aspects. All the hallmarks of ageing are observed in the brain, and its cells, especially neurons, are characterized by their remarkably long lifetime. Like any organ or system, the brain is exposed to ageing processes which affect molecules, cells, blood vessels, gross morphology and, uniquely for this organ, cognition. The preponderant cerebral structures are characterized by the cellular processes of neurons and glial cells and while the quantity of cerebral interstitial fluid is limited, it is now recognized as playing a crucial role in maintaining cerebral homeostasis. Most of our current knowledge of the ageing brain derives from studies of neurodegenerative disorders. It is interesting to note that common features of these disorders, like Tau, phosphoTau and amyloid peptide accumulation, can begin relatively early in life as a result of physiological ageing and are present in subclinical cases while also being used as early-stage markers of neurodegenerative diseases in progression. In this article, we review tissue and cellular modifications in the ageing brain. Commonly described macroscopic, microscopic and vascular changes that in the ageing brain are contrasted with those seen in neurodegenerative contexts. We also review the molecular changes that occur with age in the brain, such as modifications in gene expression, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling dysfunction, post-translational protein modifications, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy and calcium conductance changes.', 'Mutual relationship between tau and central insulin signalling: Consequences for ad and tauopathies?. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropathological changes such as Tau lesions and amyloid plaques, but also associated with non-cognitive symptomatology. Metabolic and neuroendocrine abnormalities, such as alterations in body weight, brain insulin impairments, and lower brain glucose metabolism, which often precede clinical diagnosis, have been extensively reported in AD patients. However, the origin of these symptoms and their relation to pathology and cognitive impairments remain misunderstood. Insulin is a hormone involved in the control of energy homeostasis both peripherally and centrally, and insulin-resistant state has been linked to increased risk of dementia. It is now well established that insulin resistance can exacerbate Tau lesions, mainly by disrupting the balance between Tau kinases and phosphatases. On the other hand, the emerging literature indicates that Tau protein can also modulate insulin signalling in the brain, thus creating a detrimental vicious circle. The following review will highlight our current understanding of the role of insulin in the brain and its relation to Tau protein in the context of AD and tauopathies. Considering that insulin signalling is prone to be pharmacologically targeted at multiple levels, it constitutes an appealing approach to improve both insulin brain sensitivity and mitigate brain pathology with expected positive outcome in terms of cognition.', 'The vitamin K-dependent factor, protein S, regulates brain neural stem cell migration and phagocytic activities towards glioma cells. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Due to both their invasive nature and resistance to multimodal treatments, these tumors have a very high percentage of recurrence leading in most cases to a rapid fatal outcome. Recent data demonstrated that neural stem/progenitor cells possess an inherent ability to migrate towards glioma cells, track them in the brain and reduce their growth. However, mechanisms involved in these processes have not been explored in-depth. In the present report, we investigated interactions between glioma cells and neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone, the major brain stem cell niche. Our data show that neural stem/progenitor cells are attracted by cultured glioma-derived factors. Using multiple approaches, we demonstrate for the first time that the vitamin K-dependent factor protein S produced by glioma cells is involved in tumor tropism through a mechanism involving the tyrosine kinase receptor Tyro3 that, in turn, is expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells. Neural stem/progenitor cells decrease the growth of both glioma cell cultures and clonogenic population. Cultured neural stem/progenitor cells also engulf, by phagocytosis, apoptotic glioma cell-derived fragments and this mechanism depends on the exposure of phosphatidylserine eat-me signal and is stimulated by protein S. The disclosure of a role of protein S/Tyro3 axis in neural stem/progenitor cell tumor-tropism and the demonstration of a phagocytic activity of neural stem/progenitor cells towards dead glioma cells that is regulated by protein S open up new perspectives for both stem cell biology and brain physiopathology.', 'Cerebral organoids and their potential for studies of brain diseases in domestic animals. The brain is a complex organ and any model for studying it in its normal and pathological aspects becomes a tool of choice for neuroscientists. The mastering and dissemination of protocols allowing brain organoids development have paved the way for a whole range of new studies in the field of brain development, modeling of neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental diseases, understanding tumors as well as infectious diseases that affect the brain. While studies are so far limited to the use of human cerebral organoids, there is a growing interest in having similar models in other species. This review presents what is currently developed in this field, with a particular focus on the potential of cerebral organoids for studying neuro-infectious diseases in human and domestic animals.', 'Rituximab-Induced Hypogammaglobulinemia and Infections in AQP4 and MOG Antibody-Associated Diseases. OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential association between infections and rituximab (RTX)-induced hypogammaglobulinemia among patients with CNS inflammatory diseases. METHODS: We included in a prospective observational study all consecutive adults with aquaporin 4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-positive disorders treated with RTX. Dosing schedule was adapted to memory B-cell measurement. RESULTS: We included 48 patients (mean age 47 [SD: 14] years; 77% females; 31 AQP4 positive and 17 MOG positive). The median follow-up was 3.6 years (range: 0.9-8.1 years). The median number of RTX infusions was 8 (range: 2-14). The median dosing interval was 6 months (range: 1.7-13.7 months). Sixty-seven symptomatic infections (SIs) were observed in 26 of 48 (54%) patients, including 13 severe infections in 9 (19%). Urinary and lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent, representing 42% and 21% of SI. At RTX onset, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was abnormal in 3 of 48 (6%) patients. After RTX, 15 (31%), 11 (23%), 3 (6%), and 0 of 48 patients showed sustained IgG level <7, <6, <4, and <2 g/L, respectively. On multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the main variables explaining the risk of SI were the presence of urinary tract dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR] = 34, 95% CI 4-262, p < 0.001), the dosing intervals (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p < 0.001), and the interaction between IgG level and urinary tract dysfunction (HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85, p < 0.005). IgG level <6 g/L during RTX was associated with male sex (HR = 4, 95% CI 1.4-11.4, p < 0.01) and previous immunosuppression (HR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-10, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RTX used as maintenance therapy in CNS inflammatory diseases is frequently associated with reduced IgG level and increases the infection risk of the most vulnerable patients.', 'Inter-subject registration and application of the SIGMA rat brain atlas for regional labeling in functional ultrasound imaging. Background: Recent advances using functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging have opened new avenues to evaluate brain activity through the regional monitoring of cerebral blood volume (CBV) dynamics. In particular, this technology paves the way for understanding physiological or pathological cerebral processes or exploring the pharmacological profiles of new drugs targeting brain disorders. One of the main difficulties of this technology is the lack of standardized and validated tools, in particular relevant brain atlases, to help improving the accuracy, automation and reproducibility of fUS data analysis. New method: Here, we demonstrate the possibility to use the MRI-validated SIGMA brain atlas in rat to perform fast and precise analysis of CBV changes in numerous functionally relevant regions of interest using fUS imaging. We applied this atlas to a dataset obtained in anesthetized rats evaluating the cerebral effects of atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor currently marketed in attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder. Results: This approach enabled to show the subregional effects of atomoxetine in the rat with very few inter-individual differences in some areas, such as the dentate gyrus. Conclusions: We show the feasibility of inter-individual registration of 2D pharmaco-fUS data and subsequent detailed analysis using the SIGMA atlas.', \"BACE inhibition causes rapid, regional, and non-progressive volume reduction in Alzheimer's disease brain. In the phase 3 EPOCH trial (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01739348), treatment with the BACE inhibitor verubecestat failed to improve cognition in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, but was associated with reduced hippocampal volume after 78 weeks as assessed by MRI. The aims of the present exploratory analyses were to: (i) characterize the effect of verubecestat on brain volume by evaluating the time course of volumetric MRI changes for a variety of brain regions; and (ii) understand the mechanism through which verubecestat might cause hippocampal (and other brain region) volume loss by assessing its relationship to measures of amyloid, neurodegeneration, and cognition. Participants were aged 55-85 years with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and a Mini Mental State Examination score ≥15 and ≤26. MRIs were obtained at baseline and at Weeks 13, 26, 52 and 78 of treatment. MRIs were segmented using Freesurfer and analysed using a tensor-based morphometry method. PET amyloid data were obtained with 18F-flutemetamol (Vizamyl®) at baseline and Week 78. Standardized uptake value ratios were generated with subcortical white matter as a reference region. Neurofilament light chain in the CSF was assessed as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Compared with placebo, verubecestat showed increased MRI brain volume loss at Week 13 with no evidence of additional loss through Week 78. The verubecestat-related volumetric MRI loss occurred predominantly in amyloid-rich brain regions. Correlations between amyloid burden at baseline and verubecestat-related volumetric MRI reductions were not significant (r = 0.05 to 0.26, P-values > 0.27). There were no significant differences between verubecestat and placebo in changes from baseline in CSF levels of neurofilament light chain at Week 78 (increases of 7.2 and 14.6 pg/ml for verubecestat versus 19.7 pg/ml for placebo, P-values ≥ 0.1). There was a moderate correlation between volumetric MRI changes and cognitive decline in all groups including placebo at Week 78 (e.g. r = -0.45 to -0.55, P < 0.001 for whole brain), but the correlations were smaller at Week 13 and significant only for the verubecestat groups (e.g. r = -0.15 and -0.11, P < 0.04 for whole brain). Our results suggest that the verubecestat-associated MRI brain volume loss is not due to generalized, progressive neurodegeneration, but may be mediated by specific effects on BACE-related amyloid processes.\", \"Diagnostic contribution and therapeutic perspectives of transcranial magnetic stimulation in dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to probe in vivo brain circuits, as it allows to assess several cortical properties such as excitability, plasticity and connectivity in humans. In the last 20 years, TMS has been applied to patients with dementia, enabling the identification of potential markers of the pathophysiology and predictors of cognitive decline; moreover, applied repetitively, TMS holds promise as a potential therapeutic intervention. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of studies that have employed TMS in dementia and to discuss potential clinical applications, from the diagnosis to the treatment. To provide a technical and theoretical framework, we first present an overview of the basic physiological mechanisms of the application of TMS to assess cortical excitability, excitation and inhibition balance, mechanisms of plasticity and cortico-cortical connectivity in the human brain. We then review the insights gained by TMS techniques into the pathophysiology and predictors of progression and response to treatment in dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementias and secondary dementias. We show that while a single TMS measure offers low specificity, the use of a panel of measures and/or neurophysiological index can support the clinical diagnosis and predict progression. In the last part of the article, we discuss the therapeutic uses of TMS. So far, only repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and multisite rTMS associated with cognitive training have been shown to be, respectively, possibly (Level C of evidence) and probably (Level B of evidence) effective to improve cognition, apathy, memory, and language in AD patients, especially at a mild/early stage of the disease. The clinical use of this type of treatment warrants the combination of brain imaging techniques and/or electrophysiological tools to elucidate neurobiological effects of neurostimulation and to optimally tailor rTMS treatment protocols in individual patients or specific patient subgroups with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.\", \"Prediction-based neural mechanisms for shielding the self from existential threat. The human mind has an automatic tendency to avoid awareness of its mortality. How this protective mechanism is implemented at the neuronal level is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that prediction-based mechanisms mediate death-denial by shielding the self from existential threat. We provide evidence that self-specific predictive processes are downregulated during the perception of death-related linguistic stimuli and that this mechanism can predict fear-of-death. Using a magnetoencephalography visual mismatch paradigm, we show that the brain's automatic prediction response to deviancy is eliminated when death words and self-face representations are coupled, but remains present when coupled to other-face or to negative words. We further demonstrate a functional link between how death impacts self-image vs. Other-image, and show that it predicts fear-of-death. Finally, we confirm this effect in a behavioral active inference experiment showing that death-related words bias perceptual judgment on facial self and other morphed video clips. Together these results lay out, for the first time, a plausible neural-based mechanism of death-denial.\", 'Brain imaging in catatonia: Systematic review and directions for future research. Background Catatonia is a frequent, complex and severe identifiable syndrome of motor dysregulation. However, its pathophysiology is poorly understood.Methods We aimed to provide a systematic review of all brain imaging studies (both structural and functional) in catatonia.Results We identified 137 case reports and 18 group studies representing 186 individual patients with catatonia. Catatonia is often associated with brain imaging abnormalities (in more than 75% of cases). The majority of the case reports show diffuse lesions of white matter, in a wide range of brain regions. Most of the case reports of functional imaging usually show frontal, temporal, or basal ganglia hypoperfusion. These abnormalities appear to be alleviated after successful treatment of clinical symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging studies are very scarce in the catatonia literature, mostly showing diffuse cerebral atrophy. Group studies assessing functional brain imaging after catatonic episodes show that emotional dysregulation is related to the GABAergic system, with hypoactivation of orbitofrontal cortex, hyperactivation of median prefrontal cortex, and dysconnectivity between frontal and motor areas.Conclusion In catatonia, brain imaging is abnormal in the majority of cases, and abnormalities more frequently diffuse than localised. Brain imaging studies published so far suffer from serious limitations and for now the different models presented in the literature do not explain most of the cases. There is an important need for further studies including a better clinical characterisation of patients with catatonia, functional imaging with concurrent catatonic symptoms and the use of novel brain imaging techniques.', 'A dual-process exploration of binge drinking: Evidence through behavioral and electrophysiological findings. The dual-process model, describing addictive disorders as resulting from an imbalance between increased automatic approach behaviors towards the substance and reduced abilities to control these behaviors, constitutes a sound theoretical framework to understand alcohol-use disorders. The present study aimed at exploring this imbalance at behavioral and cerebral levels in binge drinking, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption frequently observed in youth, by assessing both reflective control abilities and automatic processing of alcohol-related stimuli. For this purpose, 25 binge drinkers and 25 comparison participants performed a Go/No-Go task during electrophysiological recording. Inhibition abilities were investigated during explicit (ie, distinguishing alcoholic versus nonalcoholic drinks) and implicit (ie, distinguishing sparkling versus nonsparkling drinks, independently of their alcohol content) processing of beverage cues. Binge drinkers presented poorer inhibition for the explicit processing of beverage cues, as well as reduced N200 amplitude for the specific processing of alcohol-related stimuli. As a whole, these findings indicated inhibition impairments in binge drinkers, particularly for alcohol cues processing and at the attentional stage of the cognitive stream. In line with the dual-process model, these results support that binge drinking is already characterized by an underactivation of the reflective system combined with an overactivation of the automatic system. Results also underlined the influence of explicit processing compared with implicit ones. At the clinical level, our findings reinforce the need to develop intervention methods focusing on the inhibition of approach behaviors towards alcohol-related stimuli.', 'Characteristics in limbic encephalitis with anti-adenylate kinase 5 autoantibodies. Objective: To report 10 patients with limbic encephalitis (LE) and adenylate kinase 5 autoantibodies (AK5-Abs). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of 50 patients with LE with uncharacterized autoantibodies and identified a specific target using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and cell-based assay. Results: AK5 (a known autoantigen of LE) was identified as the target of antibodies in the CSFs and sera of 10 patients with LE (median age 64 years; range 57-80), which was characterized by subacute anterograde amnesia without seizure and sometimes preceded by a prodromal phase of asthenia or mood disturbances. Anterograde amnesia can be isolated, but some patients also complained of prosopagnosia, paroxysmal anxiety, or abnormal behavior. No associated cancer was observed. All 10 patients had bilateral hippocampal hypersignal on a brain MRI. CSF analysis generally showed a mild pleiocytosis with elevated immunoglobulin G index and oligoclonal bands, as well as high levels of tau protein with normal concentration of Aβ42 and phospho-tau, suggesting a process of neuronal death. Except for one patient, clinical response to immunotherapy was unfavorable, with persistence of severe anterograde amnesia. Two patients evolved to severe cognitive decline. Hippocampal atrophy was observed on control brain MRI. Using in vitro tests on hippocampal neurons, we did not identify clues suggesting a direct pathogenic role of AK5-Abs. Conclusions: AK5-Abs should be systematically considered in aged patients with subacute anterograde amnesia. Recognition of this disorder is important to develop new treatment strategies to prevent irreversible limbic damage.', 'Immersing Patients in a Virtual Reality Environment for Brain Mapping During Awake Surgery: Safety Study. Background: Brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation during awake craniotomy is now a standard procedure that reduces the risk of permanent neurologic deficits. Virtual reality technology immerses the patient in a virtually controlled, interactive world, offering a unique opportunity to develop innovative tasks for perioperative mapping of complex cognitive functions. The objective of this prospective single-center study was to evaluate the tolerance and safety of a virtual reality headset (VRH) and immersive virtual experiences in patients undergoing awake craniotomy and brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation. Methods: The study included 30 patients with a brain tumor near the language area. Language mapping was performed with a naming task, DO 80, presented on a digital tablet and then in two-dimensional and three-dimensional formats through a VRH. During wound closure, different virtual reality experiences were proposed to the patient, offering different types of virtual motion or interaction with an avatar piloted by a neuropsychologist. Results: Two patients could not use the VRH owing to technical issues. No procedure was aborted, no patient experienced virtual reality sickness and all patients reported they would repeat the procedure. Despite a high rate of intraoperative focal seizures, there was no argument to attribute the seizures to VRH use. Conclusions: This study shows that it is possible during awake brain surgery to immerse the patient in a virtual environment and to interact with the patient, opening the field of new brain mapping procedures for complex cognitive functions.', 'Characterization of brain dystrophins absence and impact in dystrophin-deficient Dmd<sup>mdx</sup> rat model. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin, expressed mainly in muscles but also in other tissues like retina and brain. Non-progressing cognitive dysfunction occurs in 20 to 50% of DMD patients. Furthermore, loss of expression of the Dp427 dystrophin isoform in the brain of mdx mice, the most used animal model of DMD, leads to behavioral deficits thought to be linked to insufficiencies in synaptogenesis and channel clustering at synapses. Mdx mice where the locomotor phenotype is mild also display a high and maladaptive response to stress. Recently, we generated Dmdmdx rats carrying an out-of frame mutation in exon 23 of the DMD gene and exhibiting a skeletal and cardiac muscle phenotype similar to DMD patients. In order to evaluate the impact of dystrophin loss on behavior, we explored locomotion parameters as well as anhedonia, anxiety and response to stress, in Dmdmdx rats aged from 1.5 to 7 months, in comparison to wild-type (WT) littermates. Pattern of dystrophin expression in the brain of WT and Dmdmdx rats was characterized by western-blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. We showed that dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx rats displayed motor deficits in the beam test, without association with depressive or anxiety-like phenotype. However, Dmdmdx rats exhibited a strong response to restraint-induced stress, with a large increase in freezings frequency and duration, suggesting an alteration in a functional circuit including the amygdala. In brain, large dystrophin isoform Dp427 was not expressed in mutant animals. Dmdmdx rat is therefore a good animal model for preclinical evaluations of new treatments for DMD but care must be taken with their responses to mild stress.', 'Multi-factorial modulation of hemispheric specialization and plasticity for language in healthy and pathological conditions: A review. This review synthesizes anatomo-functional variability of language hemispheric representation and specialization (hemispheric specialization for language, HSL) as well as its modulation by several variables (demographic, anatomical, developmental, genetic, clinical, and psycholinguistic) in physiological and pathological conditions. The left hemisphere (LH) dominance for language, observed in approximately 90% of healthy individuals and in 70% of patients, is grounded by intra-hemispheric connections mediated by associative bundles such as the arcuate fasciculus and inter-hemispheric transcallosal connections mediated by the corpus callosum that connects homotopic regions of the left and right hemispheres (RH). In typical brains, inter-hemispheric inhibition, exerted from the LH to the RH, permits the LH to maintain language dominance. In pathological conditions, inter- and intra-hemispheric inhibition is decreased, inducing modifications on the degree of HSL and of language networks. HSL evaluation is classically performed in clinical practice with the Wada test and electro-cortical stimulation, gold standard methods. The advent of functional neuroimaging has allowed a more detailed assessment of the language networks and their lateralization, consistent with the results provided by the gold standard methods. In the first part, we describe anatomo-functional support for HSL in healthy conditions, its developmental course, its relationship with cognitive skills, and the various modulatory factors acting on HSL. The second section is devoted to the assessment of HSL in patients with focal and drug-resistant epilepsy (FDRE). FDRE is considered a neurological model associated with patterns of language plasticity, both before and after surgery: FDRE patients show significant modification of language networks induced by changes mediated by transcallosal connections (explaining inter-hemispheric patterns of language reorganization) or collateral connections (explaining intra-hemispheric patterns of language reorganization). Finally, we propose several predictive and explicative models of language organization and reorganization.', 'Brain eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism as a lead for novel therapeutics in major depression. The results of several meta-analyses suggest that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation is therapeutic in managing the symptoms of major depression. It was previously assumed that because EPA is extremely low in the brain it did not cross the blood-brain barrier and any therapeutic effects it exerted would be via the periphery. However, more recent studies have established that EPA does enter the brain, but is rapidly metabolised following entry. While EPA does not accumulate within the brain, it is present in microglia and homeostatic mechanisms may regulate its esterification to phospholipids that serve important roles in cell signaling. Furthermore, a variety of signaling molecules from EPA have been described in the periphery and they have the potential to exert effects within the brain. If EPA is confirmed to be therapeutic in major depression as a result of adequately powered randomized clinical trials, future research on brain EPA metabolism could lead to the discovery of novel targets for treating or preventing major depression.', 'Human Endogenous Retrovirus Type W Envelope from Multiple Sclerosis Demyelinating Lesions Shows Unique Solubility and Antigenic Characteristics. In multiple sclerosis (MS), human endogenous retrovirus W family (HERV-W) envelope protein, pHERV-W ENV, limits remyelination and induces microglia-mediated neurodegeneration. To better understand its role, we examined the soluble pHERV-W antigen from MS brain lesions detected by specific antibodies. Physico-chemical and antigenic characteristics confirmed differences between pHERV-W ENV and syncytin-1. pHERV-W ENV monomers and trimers remained associated with membranes, while hexamers self-assembled from monomers into a soluble macrostructure involving sulfatides in MS brain. Extracellular hexamers are stabilized by internal hydrophobic bonds and external hydrophilic moieties. HERV-W studies in MS also suggest that this diffusible antigen may correspond to\\xa0a previously described high-molecular-weight neurotoxic factor secreted by MS B-cells and thus represents a major agonist in MS pathogenesis. Adapted methods are now needed to identify encoding HERV provirus(es) in affected cells DNA. The properties and origin of MS brain pHERV-W ENV soluble antigen will allow a better understanding of the role of HERVs in MS pathogenesis. The present results anyhow pave the way to an accurate detection of the different forms of pHERV-W ENV antigen with appropriate conditions that remained unseen until now.', \"Tau/DDX6 interaction increases microRNA activity. Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by intracellular aggregates of insoluble Tau proteins. Originally described as a microtubule binding protein, recent studies demonstrated additional physiological roles for Tau. The fact that a single protein can regulate multiple cellular functions has posed challenge in terms of understanding mechanistic cues behind the pathology. Here, we used tandem-affinity purification methodology coupled to mass spectrometry to identify novel interaction partners. We found that Tau interacts with DDX6, a DEAD box RNA helicase involved in translation repression and mRNA decay as well as in the miRNA pathway. Our results demonstrate that Tau increases the silencing activity of the miRNA let-7a, miR-21 and miR-124 through DDX6. Importantly, Tau mutations (P301S, P301L) found in the inherited tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, disrupt Tau/DDX6 interaction and impair gene silencing by let-7a. Altogether, these data demonstrated a new unexpected role for Tau in regulating miRNA activity.\", \"Genome-wide identification of genic and intergenic neuronal DNA regions bound by Tau protein under physiological and stress conditions. Tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are neurodegenerative disorders for which there is presently no cure. They are named after the abnormal oligomerization/aggregation of the neuronal microtubule-associated Tau protein. Besides its role as a microtubule-associated protein, a DNA-binding capacity and a nuclear localization for Tau protein has been described in neurons. While questioning the potential role of Tau-DNA binding in the development of tauopathies, we have carried out a large-scale analysis of the interaction of Tau protein with the neuronal genome under physiological and heat stress conditions using the ChIP-on-chip technique that combines Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) with DNA microarray (chip). Our findings show that Tau protein specifically interacts with genic and intergenic DNA sequences of primary culture of neurons with a preference for DNA regions positioned beyond the ±5000 bp range from transcription start site. An AG-rich DNA motif was found recurrently present within Tau-interacting regions and 30% of Tau-interacting regions overlapped DNA sequences coding for lncRNAs. Neurological processes affected in AD were enriched among Tau-interacting regions with in vivo gene expression assays being indicative of a transcriptional repressor role for Tau protein, which was exacerbated in neurons displaying nuclear pathological oligomerized forms of Tau protein.\", 'Peristaltic flow in the glymphatic system. The flow inside the perivascular space (PVS) is modeled using a first-principles approach in order to investigate how the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters the brain through a permeable layer of glial cells. Lubrication theory is employed to deal with the flow in the thin annular gap of the perivascular space between an impermeable artery and the brain tissue. The artery has an imposed peristaltic deformation and the deformable brain tissue is modeled by means of an elastic Hooke’s law. The perivascular flow model is solved numerically, discovering that the peristaltic wave induces a steady streaming to/from the brain which strongly depends on the rigidity and the permeability of the brain tissue. A detailed quantification of the through flow across the glial boundary is obtained for a large parameter space of physiologically relevant conditions. The parameters include the elasticity and permeability of the brain, the curvature of the artery, its length and the amplitude of the peristaltic wave. A steady streaming component of the through flow due to the peristaltic wave is characterized by an in-depth physical analysis and the velocity across the glial layer is found to flow from and to the PVS, depending on the elasticity and permeability of the brain. The through CSF flow velocity is quantified to be of the order of micrometers per seconds.', 'The pericyte-glia interface at the blood-brain barrier. The cerebrovasculature is a multicellular structure with varying rheological and permeability properties. The outer wall of the brain capillary endothelium is enclosed by pericytes and astrocyte end feet, anatomically assembled to guarantee barrier functions. We, here, focus on the pericyte modifications occurring in disease conditions, reviewing evidence supporting the interplay amongst pericytes, the endothelium, and glial cells in health and pathology. Deconstruction and reactivity of pericytes and glial cells around the capillary endothelium occur in response to traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders, impacting vascular permeability and participating in neuroinflammation. As this represents a growing field of research, addressing the multicellular reorganization occurring at the outer wall of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in response to an acute insult or a chronic disease could disclose novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'Impact of dietary fats on brain functions. Background: Adequate dietary intake and nutritional status have important effects on brain functions and on brain health. Energy intake and specific nutrients excess or deficiency from diet differently affect cognitive processes, emotions, behaviour, neuroendocrine functions and synaptic plasticity with possible protective or detrimental effects on neuronal physiology. Lipids, in particular, play structural and functional roles in neurons. Here the importance of dietary fats and the need to understand the brain mechanisms activated by peripheral and central metabolic sensors. Thus, the manipulation of lifestyle factors such as dietary interventions may represent a successful therapeutic approach to maintain and preserve brain health along lifespan. Methods: This review aims at summarizing the impact of dietary fats on brain functions. Results: Starting from fat consumption, nutrient sensing and food-related reward, the impact of gut-brain communications will be discussed in brain health and disease. A specific focus will be on the impact of fats on the molecular pathways within the hypothalamus involved in the control of reproduction via the expression and the release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone. Lastly, the effects of specific lipid classes such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and of the \"fattest\" of all diets, commonly known as \"ketogenic diets\", on brain functions will also be discussed. Conclusion: Despite the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms is still a work in progress, the clinical relevance of the manipulation of dietary fats is well acknowledged and such manipulations are in fact currently in use for the treatment of brain diseases.', 'Keep calm: Psychiatric disorders are organic! The power of words in medicine. ', 'Does endogenous cholecystokinin modulate alcohol intake?. Alcohol use disorder or alcoholism is characterized by uncontrollable alcohol use and intoxication, as well as a heightened state of anxiety after alcohol withdrawal. Ethanol-associated stimuli also drive the urge to drink by means of classical conditioning. Alcoholism has been considered a dopamine (DA) dysregulation syndrome that involves the activity of the central amygdala circuitry of anxiety. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the most abundant neuropeptide in the mammal brain, where it activates two receptors, CCK1 and CCK2. Genetic evidence relates CCK1 receptors to alcoholism in humans. CCK2 activity has been associated with the onset of human anxiety. CCK modulates DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and it is expressed in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing basket interneurons in the cerebral cortex. CCK interacts with serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission through 5-HT3 receptors to regulate mesocorticolimbic pathways and with GABA to attenuate anxiety in the amygdala. Finally, CCK stimulates the release of orexins and oxytocin in the hypothalamus, two relevant hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in signaling satiety for ethanol and well-being respectively. Given the “dimmer-switch” function of endogenous CCK in the neurotransmission by 5-HT, DA, GABA, and glutamate in normal and pathological behaviors (Ballaz and Bourin, 2020), we hypothesize that CCK adjusts functioning of the reward and anxiety circuitries altered by ethanol. This review gathers data supporting this hypothesis, and suggests mechanisms underlying a role for endogenous CCK in alcoholism.', 'The MRi-Share database: brain imaging in a cross-sectional cohort of 1870 university students. We report on MRi-Share, a multi-modal brain MRI database acquired in a unique sample of 1870 young healthy adults, aged 18–35\\xa0years, while undergoing university-level education. MRi-Share contains structural (T1 and FLAIR), diffusion (multispectral), susceptibility-weighted (SWI), and resting-state functional imaging modalities. Here, we described the contents of these different neuroimaging datasets and the processing pipelines used to derive brain phenotypes, as well as how quality control was assessed. In addition, we present preliminary results on associations of some of these brain image-derived phenotypes at the whole brain level with both age and sex, in the subsample of 1722 individuals aged less than 26\\xa0years. We demonstrate that the post-adolescence period is characterized by changes in both structural and microstructural brain phenotypes. Grey matter cortical thickness, surface area and volume were found to decrease with age, while white matter volume shows increase. Diffusivity, either radial or axial, was found to robustly decrease with age whereas fractional anisotropy only slightly increased. As for the neurite orientation dispersion and densities, both were found to increase with age. The isotropic volume fraction also showed a slight increase with age. These preliminary findings emphasize the complexity of changes in brain structure and function occurring in this critical period at the interface of late maturation and early ageing.', 'Mass spectrometry imaging of mice brain lipid profile changes over time under high fat diet. Overweight and obesity have been shown to significantly affect brain structures and size. Obesity has been associated with cerebral atrophy, alteration of brain functions, including cognitive impairement, and psychiatric diseases such as depression. Given the importance of lipids in the structure of the brain, here, by using 47 mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) with 60% calories from fat (40% saturated fatty acids) and 20% calories from carbohydrates and age-matched control animals on a normal chow diet, we examined the effects of HFD and diet-induced obesity on the brain lipidome. Using a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis and a non-targeted mass spectrometry MALDI imaging approach, we show that the relative concentration of most lipids, in particular brain phospholipids, is modified by diet-induced obesity (+ 40%of body weight). Use of a non-targeted MALDI-MS imaging approach further allowed define cerebral regions of interest (ROI) involved in eating behavior and changes in their lipid profile. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the obese/chow lipidome revealed persistence of some of the changes in the brain lipidome of obese animals even after their switch to chow feeding and associated weight loss. Altogether, these data reveal that HFD feeding rapidly modifies the murine brain lipidome. Some of these HFD-induced changes persist even after weight loss, implying that some brain sequelae caused by diet-induced obesity are irreversible.', 'Advances in user-training for mental-imagery-based BCI control: Psychological and cognitive factors and their neural correlates. While being very promising for a wide range of applications, mental-imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) remain barely used outside laboratories, notably due to the difficulties users encounter when attempting to control them. Indeed, 10–30% of users are unable to control MI-BCIs (so-called BCI illiteracy) while only a small proportion reach acceptable control abilities. This huge interuser variability has led the community to investigate potential predictors of performance related to users’ personality and cognitive profile. Based on a literature review, we propose a classification of these MI-BCI performance predictors into three categories representing high-level cognitive concepts: (1) users’ relationship with the technology (including the notions of computer anxiety and sense of agency), (2) attention, and (3) spatial abilities. We detail these concepts and their neural correlates in order to better understand their relationship with MI-BCI user-training. Consequently, we propose, by way of future prospects, some guidelines to improve MI-BCI user-training.', \"Resting state oscillations suggest a motor component of Parkinson's Impulse Control Disorders. Objectives: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been associated with cognitive impulsivity and dopaminergic dysfunction and treatment. The present study tests the neglected hypothesis that the neurofunctional networks involved in motor impulsivity might also be dysfunctional in PD-ICDs. Methods: We performed blind spectral analyses of resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) data in PD patients with and without ICDs to probe the functional integrity of all cortical networks. Analyses were performed directly at the source level after blind source separation. Discrete differences between groups were tested by comparing patients with and without ICDs. Gradual dysfunctions were assessed by means of correlations between power changes and clinical scores reflecting ICD severity (QUIP score). Results: Spectral signatures of ICDs were found in the medial prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate and the supplementary motor area, in the beta and gamma bands. Beta power changes in the supplementary motor area were found to predict ICDs severity. Conclusion: ICDs are associated with abnormal activity within frequency bands and cortical circuits supporting the control of motor response inhibition. Significance: These results bring to the forefront the need to consider, in addition to the classical interpretation based on aberrant mesocorticolimbic reward processing, the issue of motor impulsivity in PD-ICDs and its potential implications for PD therapy.\", 'Relevance of the proteolytic processing of reelin by ADAMTS-3 in brain functions. ', \"Early-life experiences and the development of adult diseases with a focus on mental illness: The Human Birth Theory. In mammals, early adverse experiences, including mother–pup interactions, shape the response of an individual to chronic stress or to stress-related diseases during adult life. This has led to the elaboration of the theory of the developmental origins of health and disease, in particular adult diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In addition, in humans, as stated by Massimo Fagioli's Human Birth Theory, birth is healthy and equal for all individuals, so that mental illness develop exclusively in the postnatal period because of the quality of the relationship in the first year of life. Thus, this review focuses on the importance of programming during the early developmental period on the manifestation of adult diseases in both animal models and humans. Considering the obvious differences between animals and humans we cannot systematically move from animal models to humans. Consequently, in the first part of this review, we will discuss how animal models can be used to dissect the influence of adverse events occurring during the prenatal and postnatal periods on the developmental trajectories of the offspring, and in the second part, we will discuss the role of postnatal critical periods on the development of mental diseases in humans. Epigenetic mechanisms that cause reversible modifications in gene expression, driving the development of a pathological phenotype in response to a negative early postnatal environment, may lie at the core of this programming, thereby providing potential new therapeutic targets. The concept of the Human Birth Theory leads to a comprehension of the mental illness as a pathology of the human relationship immediately after birth and during the first year of life.\", \"Vascular Cognitive Impairment. Cerebrovascular disease typically manifests with stroke, cognitive impairment, or both. Vascular cognitive impairment refers to all forms of cognitive disorder associated with cerebrovascular disease, regardless of the specific mechanisms involved. It encompasses the full range of cognitive deficits from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. In principle, any of the multiple causes of clinical stroke can cause vascular cognitive impairment. Recent work further highlights a role of microinfarcts, microhemorrhages, strategic white matter tracts, loss of microstructural tissue integrity, and secondary neurodegeneration. Vascular brain injury results in loss of structural and functional connectivity and, hence, compromise of functional networks within the brain. Vascular cognitive impairment is common both after stroke and in stroke-free individuals presenting to dementia clinics, and vascular pathology frequently coexists with neurodegenerative pathology, resulting in mixed forms of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Vascular dementia is now recognized as the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and there is increasing awareness that targeting vascular risk may help to prevent dementia, even of the Alzheimer type. Recent advances in neuroimaging, neuropathology, epidemiology, and genetics have led to a deeper understanding of how vascular disease affects cognition. These new findings provide an opportunity for the present reappraisal of vascular cognitive impairment. We further briefly address current therapeutic concepts.\", 'Teenage-onset progressive myoclonic epilepsy due to a familial C9orf72 repeat expansion. Background The progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PME) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which a specific diagnosis cannot be made in a subset of patients, despite exhaustive investigation. C9orf72 repeat expansions are emerging as an important causal factor in several adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, in particular frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An association with PME has not been reported previously. Objective To identify the causative mutation in a Belgian family where the proband had genetically unexplained PME. Results We report a 33-year old woman who had epilepsy since the age of 15 and then developed progressive cognitive deterioration and multifocal myoclonus at the age of 18. The family history suggested autosomal dominant inheritance of psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and dementia. Thorough workup for PME including whole exome sequencing did not reveal an underlying cause, but a C9orf72 repeat expansion was found in our patient and affected relatives. Brain biopsy confirmed the presence of characteristic p62-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Conclusion C9orf72 mutation analysis should be considered in patients with PME and psychiatric disorders or dementia, even when the onset is in late childhood or adolescence.', 'Electrophysiological and microstructural features of sleep in\\xa0children\\xa0at high risk for depression: a preliminary study. Objective This preliminary study investigated electrophysiological and microstructural features of sleep in children and adolescents 4–18 years of age who were born to depressed mothers. Methods A total of 31 healthy subjects (15 male and 16 female) participated in the study. In this sample, 20 children born to mothers diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were designated as “high-risk”; 11 children born to mothers without a personal history of depression were designated as “low-risk.” Polysomnography including three-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded for one night at the Pediatric Sleep Unit of the University Hospital of Lyon, France. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Sleep architectural parameters were analyzed. Sleep microstructure was assessed with the scoring of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and CAP measures were calculated. Spectral analysis was performed, and mean EEG band power was computed for each sleep stage. Sleep electrophysiological features (slow waves and sleep spindles) were detected, and related parameters were analyzed. Data were compared between high- and low-risk groups using Student t tests. Results A reduction in low-frequency spindle activity and slow spindles spatio-temporal characteristics over frontal and central derivations, and an altered distribution of CAP phase A subtypes (reduction of A1 over A2–3 ratio) were observed in the high-risk group relative to the low-risk group. Conclusion Limited spindles generation and increased non-rapid eye movement sleep instability, observed in children born to depressed mothers, might reflect functional anomalies in cortical plasticity that could represent a pathogenic factor or an epiphenomenon for MDD.', 'Spatio-temporal common pattern: A companion method for ERP analysis in the time domain. Background: Already used at the incept of research on event-related potentials (ERP) over half a century ago, the arithmetic mean is still the benchmark for ERP estimation. Such estimation, however, requires a large number of sweeps and/or a careful rejection of artifacts affecting the electroencephalographic recording. New method: In this article we propose a method for estimating ERPs as they are naturally contaminated by biological and instrumental artifacts. The proposed estimator makes use of multivariate spatio-temporal filtering to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This approach integrates a number of relevant advances in ERP data analysis, such as single-sweep adaptive estimation of amplitude and latency and the use of multivariate regression to account for ERP overlapping in time. Results: We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator analyzing a dataset comprising 24 subjects involving a visual odd-ball paradigm, without performing any artifact rejection. Comparison with existing method(s): As compared to the arithmetic average, a lower number of sweeps is needed. Furthermore, artifact rejection can be performed roughly using permissive automatic procedures. Conclusion: The proposed ensemble average estimator yields a reference companion to the arithmetic ensemble average estimation, suitable both in clinical and research settings. The method can be applied equally to event related fields (ERF) recorded by means of magnetoencephalography. In this article we describe all necessary methodological details to promote testing and comparison of this proposed method by peers. Furthermore, we release a MATLAB toolbox, a plug-in for the EEGLAB software suite and a stand-alone executable application.', 'The phase of ongoing EEG oscillations predicts the amplitude of peri-saccadic mislocalization. Our constant eye movements mean that updating processes, such as saccadic remapping, are essential for the maintenance of a stable spatial representation of the world around us. It has been proposed that, rather than continually update a full spatiotopic map, only the location of a few key objects is updated, suggesting that the process is linked to attention. At the same time, mounting evidence links attention to oscillatory neuronal processes. We therefore hypothesized that updating processes should themselves show oscillatory characteristics, inherited from underlying attentional processes. To test this, we carried out a combined psychophysics and EEG experiment in human participants, using a saccadic mislocalization task as a behaviourally measureable proxy for spatial updating, and simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. We then used a time-frequency analysis to test for a correlation between oscillation phase and perceptual outcome. We found a significant phase-dependence of mislocalization in a time-frequency region from around 400 ms prior to saccade initiation and peaking at around 7 Hz, principally apparent over occipital electrodes. Thus the degree of perceived mislocalization is correlated with the phase of a theta-frequency oscillation prior to saccade onset. We conclude that spatial updating processes are indeed linked to rhythmic processes in the brain.', \"Identification of altered brain metabolites associated with TNAP activity in a mouse model of hypophosphatasia using untargeted NMR-based metabolomics analysis. Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is a key player of bone mineralization and TNAP gene (ALPL) mutations in human are responsible for hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare heritable disease affecting the mineralization of bones and teeth. Moreover, TNAP is also expressed by brain cells and the severe forms of HPP are associated with neurological disorders, including epilepsy and brain morphological anomalies. However, TNAP's role in the nervous system remains poorly understood. To investigate its neuronal functions, we aimed to identify without any a priori the metabolites regulated by TNAP in the nervous tissue. For this purpose we used 1H- and 31P\\xa0NMR to analyze the brain metabolome of Alpl (Akp2) mice null for TNAP function, a well-described model of infantile HPP. Among 39 metabolites identified in brain extracts of 1-week-old animals, eight displayed significantly different concentration in Akp2−/− compared to Akp2+/+ and Akp2+/− mice: cystathionine, adenosine, GABA, methionine, histidine, 3-methylhistidine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, with cystathionine and adenosine levels displaying the strongest alteration. These metabolites identify several biochemical processes that directly or indirectly involve TNAP function, in particular through the regulation of ecto-nucleotide levels and of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. Some of these metabolites are involved in neurotransmission (GABA, adenosine), in myelin synthesis (NAA, NAAG), and in the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway (cystathionine, methionine). Their disturbances may contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neurological phenotype of HPP. (Figure presented.).\", 'Human or not human? Performance monitoring ERPs during human agent and machine supervision. Performance monitoring is a critical process which allows us to both learn from our own errors, and also interact with other human beings. However, our increasingly automated world requires us to interact more and more with automated systems, especially in risky environments. The present EEG study aimed at investigating and comparing the neuro-functional correlates associated with performance monitoring of an automated system and a human agent using a vertically-oriented arrowhead version of the flanker task. Given the influence of task difficulty on performance monitoring, two levels of difficulty were considered in order to assess their impact on supervision activity. A large N2-P3 complex in fronto-central regions was observed for both human agent error detection and system error detection during supervision. Using a cluster-based permutation analysis, a significantly decreased P3-like component was found for system compared to human agent error detection. This variation is in line with various psychosocial behavioral studies showing a difference between human-human and human-machine interactions, even though it was not clearly anticipated. Finally, the activity observed during error detection was significantly reduced in the difficult condition compared to the easy one, for both system and human agent supervision. Overall, this study is a first step towards the characterization of the neurophysiological correlates underlying system supervision, and a better understanding of their evolution in more complex environments. To go further, these results need to be replicated in other experiments with various paradigms to assess the robustness of the pattern and decrease during system supervision.', 'Is Fat Mass Cross-Sectionally Associated with Cortical Aβ Load in the Human Brain?. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship of fat mass (FM) with brain amyloid (Aβ) load in older adults. Methods: Data from the Multidomain Alzheimer’s Preventive Trial (MAPT) for Positron emission tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used. Linear regressions controlling for appendicular muscle, age, education, clinical dementia rating scale and Apolipoprotein-E were performed to explore the relationships between FM, trunk FM and Aβ-load. Results: Thirty-nine participants (75.7 ± 4.2 years old) with an average BMI of 27.5 ± 4.0 kg/m2 were analyzed in this study. There were significant and positive associations of both total and trunk FM with Aβ load [0.01 (0.002-0.02) and 0.02 (0.001-0.04), respectively]; however, when adding ApoE-ε4 as a confounder, associations were no longer significant. Conclusions: This study has found associations between FM as measured by DXA and cerebral Aβ load, suggesting that excessive FM might be involved in AD pathology.', 'Evaluation of performance monitoring ERPs through difficulty manipulation in a response-feedback paradigm. Performance monitoring is an amply studied function, since it is of major importance in carrying out actions in our everyday life. No consensus has been reached on the functional role and the relationship between each event-related potential (ERP) characterizing this function. In this study, we used a modified version of the flanker task, measuring the impact of task difficulty on the amplitudes of response-locked and feedback-locked performance monitoring ERPs in a single trial. We observed a functional differentiation between fronto-central (ERN/CRN and FRN) and centro-parietal (Pe/Pc and P300) components: the former seem to be only sensitive to accuracy, whereas the latter seem to be mainly modulated by task difficulty. The use of a surface Laplacian transformation, estimating current source density, on our data also supported an effect of difficulty on centro-parietal response-locked and feedback-locked ERPs. This technique allowed the spatial resolution to be improved and provided clarity, associated with the difficulty manipulation, on the activity of response-locked and feedback-locked performance monitoring ERPs.', \"Clinical and neurocognitive aspects of hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease. Due to their prevalence, hallucinations are considered as one of the most frequent psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These psychotic manifestations reduce patients’ well-being, increase the burden of caregivers, contribute to early institutionalization, and are related with the course of cognitive decline in AD. Considering their consequences, we provide a comprehensive account of the current state of knowledge about the prevalence and characteristics of hallucinations in AD. We propose a comprehensive and testable theoretical model about hallucinations in AD: the ALZHA (ALZheimer and HAllucinations) model. In this model, neurological, genetic, cognitive, affective, and iatrogenic factors associated with hallucinations in AD are highlighted. According to the ALZHA model, hallucinations in AD first involve trait markers (i.e., cognitive deficits, neurological deficits, genetic predisposition and/or sensory deficits) to which state markers that may trigger these experiences are added (e.g., psychological distress and/or iatrogenic factors). Finally, we provide recommendations for assessment and management of these psychotic manifestations in AD, with the aim to benefit patients, caregivers, and health professionals.\", 'Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) infiltrate haematoma and surrounding brain tissue after intracerebral haemorrhage: A post-mortem study. Aims: Because of their prothrombotic and neuroinflammatory effects, neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent interesting therapeutic targets for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH). We investigated the presence, spatial and temporal distribution of NETs in a human sICH post-mortem study. Methods: From 2005 to 2019, all sICH patients who came to autopsy within the first month after stroke were included and grouped according to the timing of death: 72\\xa0h, 4–7\\xa0days, 8–15\\xa0days and >15\\xa0days after ICH onset. Paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted from four strategic areas: haematoma, peri-haematomal area, ipsilateral surrounding brain tissue and a control contralateral area. Myeloperoxidase and histone H3 citrulline were immunolabelled to detect neutrophils and NETs respectively. Results: Neutrophils were present in the brains of the 14 cases (4 men, median age: 78\\xa0years) and NETs were found in 7/14 cases. Both neutrophils and NETs were detected within the haematoma but also in the surrounding tissue. The appearance of neutrophils and NETs was time-dependent, following a two-wave pattern: during the first 72\\xa0h and between 8 and 15\\xa0days after ICH onset. Qualitative examination showed that neutrophils and NETs were mainly located around dense fibrin fibres within the haematoma. Conclusions: These observations provide evidence for NETs infiltration in the brain of patients who die from sICH. NETs might interact with early haemostasis within the haematoma core, and with the surrounding neuroinflammatory response. These findings open research perspectives for NETs in the treatment of sICH injuries.', 'Electrophysiological correlates of emotional face processing after mild traumatic brain injury in preschool children. Evidence suggests that social skills are affected by childhood mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but the neural and affective substrates of these difficulties are still underexplored. In particular, nothing is known about consequences on the perception of emotional facial expressions, despite its critical role in social interactions and the importance of the preschool period in the development of this ability. This study thus aimed to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of emotional facial expressions processing after early mTBI. To this end, 18 preschool children (mean age 53 ± 8\\xa0months) who sustained mTBI and 15 matched healthy controls (mean age 55 ± 11\\xa0months) were presented with pictures of faces expressing anger, happiness, or no emotion (neutral) while event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. The main results revealed that P1 amplitude was higher for happy faces than for angry faces, and that N170 latency was shorter for emotional faces than for neutral faces in the control group only. These findings suggest that preschool children who sustain mTBI do not present the early emotional effects that are observed in healthy preschool children at visuospatial and visual expertise stages. This study provides new evidence regarding the consequences of childhood mTBI on socioemotional processing, by showing alterations of emotional facial expressions processing, an ability known to underlie social competence and appropriate social interactions.', \"Protein network exploration prioritizes targets for modulating neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Neuroinflammation, another hallmark of the disease, is thought to play an important role in the neurodegenerative process. While mitigating neuroinflammation could prove beneficial for Parkinson's disease, identifying the most relevant biological processes and pharmacological targets as well as drugs to modulate them remains highly challenging. The present study aimed to better understand the protein network behind neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease and to prioritize possible targets for its pharmacological modulation. We first used text-mining to systematically collect the proteins significantly associated to Parkinson's disease neuroinflammation over the scientific literature. The functional interaction network formed by these proteins was then analyzed by integrating functional enrichment, network topology analysis and drug–protein interaction analysis. We identified 57 proteins significantly associated to neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. Toll-like Receptor Cascades as well as Interleukin 4, Interleukin 10 and Interleukin 13 signaling appeared as the most significantly enriched biological processes. Protein network analysis using STRING and CentiScaPe identified 8 proteins with the highest ability to control these biological processes underlying neuroinflammation, namely caspase 1, heme oxygenase 1, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 4, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha and toll-like receptor 4. These key proteins were indexed to be targetable by a total of 38 drugs including 27 small compounds 11 protein-based therapies. In conclusion, our study highlights key proteins in Parkinson's disease neuroinflammation as well as pharmacological compounds acting on them. As such, it may facilitate the prioritization of biomarkers for the development of diagnostic, target-engagement assessment and therapeutic tools against Parkinson's disease.\", 'The relationship between CSF biomarkers and cerebral metabolism in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Purpose: One can reasonably suppose that cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers can identify distinct subgroups of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. In order to better understand differences in CSF biomarker patterns, we used FDG PET to assess cerebral metabolism in CSF-based subgroups of AD patients. Methods: Eighty-five patients fulfilling the criteria for probable early-onset AD (EOAD) underwent lumbar puncture, brain 18 F-FDG PET and MRI. A cluster analysis was performed, with the CSF biomarkers for AD as variables. Vertex-wise, partial-volume-corrected metabolic maps were computed for the patients and compared between the clusters of patients. Linear correlations between each CSF biomarker and the metabolic maps were assessed. Results: Three clusters emerged. The “Aβ42” cluster contained 32 patients with low levels of Aβ42, while tau and p-tau remained within the normal range. The “Aβ42 + tau” cluster contained 41 patients with low levels of Aβ42 and high levels of tau and p-tau. Lastly, the “tau” cluster contained 12 patients with very high levels of tau and p-tau and low-normal levels of Aβ42. There were no inter-cluster differences in age, sex ratio, educational level, APOE genotype, disease duration or disease severity. The “Aβ42 + tau” and “tau” clusters displayed more marked frontal hypometabolism than the “Aβ42” cluster did, and frontal metabolism was significantly negatively correlated with the CSF tau level. The “Aβ42” and “Aβ42 + tau” clusters displayed more marked hypometabolism in the left occipitotemporal region than the “tau” cluster did, and metabolism in this region was significantly and positively correlated with the CSF Aβ42 level. Conclusion: The CSF biomarkers can be used to identify metabolically distinct subgroups of patients with EOAD. Future research should seek to establish whether these biochemical differences have clinical consequences.', 'Spontaneous neural oscillations bias perception by modulating baseline excitability. The brain exhibits organized fluctuations of neural activity, even in the absence of tasks or sensory input. A prominent type of such spontaneous activity is the alpha rhythm, which influences perception and interacts with other ongoing neural activity. It is currently hypothesized that states of decreased prestimulus α oscillations indicate enhanced neural excitability, resulting in improved perceptual acuity. Nevertheless, it remains debatedhowchanges inexcitabilitymanifest at thebehavioral level inperceptual tasks. Weaddressedthis issue by comparing two alternative models describing the effect of spontaneous α power on signal detection. The first model assumes that decreased α power increases baseline excitability, amplifying the response to both signal and noise, predicting a liberal detection criterion with no effect on sensitivity. The second model predicts that decreased α power increases the trial-by-trial precision of the sensory response, resulting in improved sensitivity. We tested these models in two EEG experiments in humans where we analyzed the effects of prestimulus α power on visual detection and discrimination using a signal detection framework. Both experiments provide strong evidence that decreased α power reflects a more liberal detection criterion, rather than improved sensitivity, consistent with the baseline model. In other words, when the task requires detecting stimulus presence versus absence, reduced α oscillations make observers more likely to report the stimulus regardless of actual stimulus presence. Contrary to previous interpretations, these results suggest that states of decreased α oscillations increase the global baseline excitability of sensory systems without affecting perceptual acuity.', 'Boosting Norepinephrine Transmission Triggers Flexible Reconfiguration of Brain Networks at Rest. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system is thought to act as a reset signal allowing brain network reorganization in response to salient information in the environment. However, no direct evidence of NE-dependent whole-brain reorganization has ever been described. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in monkeys to investigate the impact of NE-reuptake inhibition on whole-brain connectivity patterns. We found that boosting NE transmission changes functional connectivity between and within resting-state networks. It modulated the functional connectivity pattern of a brainstem network including the LC region and interactions between associative and sensory-motor networks as well as within sensory-motor networks. Among the observed changes, those involving the fronto-parietal attention network exhibited a unique pattern of uncoupling with other sensory-motor networks and correlation switching from negative to positive with the brainstem network that included the LC nucleus. These findings provide the first empirical evidence of NE-dependent large-scale brain network reorganization and further demonstrate that the fronto-parietal attention network represents a central feature within this reorganization.', 'Can multilayer brain networks be a real step forward?: Comment on “Network science of biological systems at different scales: A review” by M. Gosak et al.. ', 'A rapid, objective and implicit measure of visual quantity discrimination. There is evidence that accurate and rapid judgments of visual quantities form an essential component of human mathematical ability. However, explicit behavioural discrimination measures of visual quantities are readily contaminated both by variations in low-level physical parameters and higher order cognitive factors, while implicit measures often lack objectivity and sensitivity at the individual participant level. Here, with electrophysiological frequency tagging, we show discrimination differences between briefly presented visual quantities as low as a ratio of 1.4 (i.e., 14 vs. 10 elements). From this threshold, the neural discrimination response increases with parametrically increasing differences in ratio between visual quantities. Inter-individual variability in magnitude of the EEG response at this population threshold ratio predicts behavioural performance at an independent number comparison task. Overall, these findings indicate that visual quantities are perceptually discriminated automatically and rapidly (i.e., at a glance) within the occipital cortex. Given its high sensitivity, this paradigm could provide an implicit diagnostic neural marker of this process suitable for a wide range of fundamental and clinical applications.', 'Promoting brain health through exercise and diet in older adults: a physiological perspective. The rise in incidence of age-related cognitive impairment is a global health concern. Ageing is associated with a number of changes in the brain that, collectively, contribute to the declines in cognitive function observed in older adults. Structurally, the ageing brain atrophies as white and grey matter volumes decrease. Oxidative stress and inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction thereby hampering cerebral perfusion and thus delivery of energy substrates and nutrients. Further, the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles contributes to neuronal loss. Of interest, there are substantial inter-individual differences in the degree to which these physical and functional changes impact upon cognitive function as we grow older. This review describes how engaging in physical activity and cognitive activities and adhering to a Mediterranean style diet promote ‘brain health’. From a physiological perspective, we discuss the effects of these modifiable lifestyle behaviours on the brain, and how some recent human trials are beginning to show some promise as to the effectiveness of lifestyle behaviours in combating cognitive impairment. Moreover, we propose that these lifestyle behaviours, through numerous mechanisms, serve to increase brain, cerebrovascular and cognitive reserve, thereby preserving and enhancing cognitive function for longer. (Figure presented.).', 'Tau pathology in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease revisited. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a human prion disease with different etiologies. To determine the spectrum of tau pathologies in CJD, we assessed phospho-Tau (pTau) immunoreactivities in 75 sporadic CJD cases including an evaluation of the entorhinal cortex and six hippocampal subregions. Twelve cases (16%) showed only small tau-immunoreactive neuritic profiles. Fifty-two (69.3%) showed additional tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe compatible with primary age related tauopathy (PART). In 22/52 cases the lower pTau immunoreactivity load in the entorhinal cortex as compared to subiculum, dentate gyrus or CA4 region of the hippocampus was significantly different from the typical distribution of the Braak staging. A further 11 cases (14.7%) showed widespread tau pathologies compatible with features of primary tauopathies or the gray matter type of ageing-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG). Prominent gray matter ARTAG was also observed in two out of three additionally examined V203I genetic CJD cases. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed prominent increase of total tau protein in cases with widespread tau pathology, while pTau (T181) level was increased only in four. This correlated with immunohistochemical observations showing less pathology with anti-pTau T181 antibody when compared to anti-pTau S202/T205, T212/S214 and T231. The frequency of tau pathologies is not unusually high in sporadic CJD and does not precisely relate to PrP deposition. However, the pattern of hippocampal tau pathology often deviates from the stages of Braak. Currently applied examination of cerebrospinal fluid pTau (T181) level does not reliably reflect primary tauopathies, PART and ARTAG seen in CJD brains.', 'The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) reader UHRF2 is required for normal levels of 5hmc in mouse adult brain and spatial learning and memory. UHRF2 has been implicated as a novel regulator for both DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC), but its physiological function and role in DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation are unknown. Here we show that in mice, UHRF2 is more abundantly expressed in the brain and a few other tissues. Uhrf2 knock-out mice are viable and fertile and exhibit no gross defect. Although there is no significant change of DNA methylation, the Uhrf2 null mice exhibit a reduction of 5hmC in the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, the Uhrf2 null mice exhibit a partial impairment in spatial memory acquisition and retention. Consistent with the phenotype, gene expression profiling uncovers a role for UHRF2 in regulating neuron-related gene expression. Finally, we provide evidence that UHRF2 binds 5hmC in cells but does not appear to affect the TET1 enzymatic activity. Together, our study supports UHRF2 as a bona fide 5hmC reader and further demonstrates a role for 5hmC in neuronal function.', 'Neuronal expression of a thyroid hormone receptor α mutation alters mouse behaviour. In humans, alterations in thyroid hormone signalling are associated with mood and anxiety disorders, but the neural mechanisms underlying such association are poorly understood. The present study investigates the involvement of neuronal thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) in anxiety, using mouse genetics and Cre/loxP technology to specifically alter TRα signalling in neurons. We evaluated the behaviour of mice expressing a dominant negative, neuron-specific mutation of TRα (TRαAMI/Cre3 mice), using the elevated-plus maze, light-dark box and open-field tests. In a first experiment, mice were housed individually, and the behaviour of TRαAMI/Cre3 mice differed significantly from that of control littermates in these 3 tests, suggesting heightened anxiety. In a second experiment, designed to evaluate the robustness of the results with the same 3 tests, mice were housed in groups. In these conditions, the behaviour of TRαAMI/Cre3 mice differed from that of control littermates only in the light-dark box. Thus, TRαAMI/Cre3 mice appear to be more likely to develop anxiety under stressful housing conditions than control mice. These results suggest that in adult mice, thyroid hormone signalling in neurons, via TRα, is involved in the control of anxiety behaviour.', 'Multi-atlas attenuation correction supports full quantification of static and dynamic brain PET data in PET-MR. In simultaneous PET-MR, attenuation maps are not directly available. Essential for absolute radioactivity quantification, they need to be derived from MR or PET data to correct for gamma photon attenuation by the imaged object. We evaluate a multi-atlas attenuation correction method for brain imaging (MaxProb) on static [18F]FDG PET and, for the first time, on dynamic PET, using the serotoninergic tracer [18F]MPPF. A database of 40 MR/CT image pairs (atlases) was used. The MaxProb method synthesises subject-specific pseudo-CTs by registering each atlas to the target subject space. Atlas CT intensities are then fused via label propagation and majority voting. Here, we compared these pseudo-CTs with the real CTs in a leave-one-out design, contrasting the MaxProb approach with a simplified single-atlas method (SingleAtlas). We evaluated the impact of pseudo-CT accuracy on reconstructed PET images, compared to PET data reconstructed with real CT, at the regional and voxel levels for the following: radioactivity images; time-activity curves; and kinetic parameters (non-displaceable binding potential, BPND). On static [18F]FDG, the mean bias for MaxProb ranged between 0 and 1% for 73 out of 84 regions assessed, and exceptionally peaked at 2.5% for only one region. Statistical parametric map analysis of MaxProb-corrected PET data showed significant differences in less than 0.02% of the brain volume, whereas SingleAtlas-corrected data showed significant differences in 20% of the brain volume. On dynamic [18F]MPPF, most regional errors on BPND ranged from -1 to +3% (maximum bias 5%) for the MaxProb method. With SingleAtlas, errors were larger and had higher variability in most regions. PET quantification bias increased over the duration of the dynamic scan for SingleAtlas, but not for MaxProb. We show that this effect is due to the interaction of the spatial tracer-distribution heterogeneity variation over time with the degree of accuracy of the attenuation maps. This work demonstrates that inaccuracies in attenuation maps can induce bias in dynamic brain PET studies. Multi-atlas attenuation correction with MaxProb enables quantification on hybrid PET-MR scanners, eschewing the need for CT.', 'Early-onset encephalopathy with paroxysmal movement disorders and epileptic seizures without hemiplegic attacks: About three children with novel ATP1A3 mutations. Objective: Heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene are responsible for various neurological disorders, ranging from early-onset alternating hemiplegia of childhood to adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Next generation sequencing allowed the description of other phenotypes, including early-onset epileptic encephalopathy in two patients. We report on three more patients carrying ATP1A3 mutations with a close phenotype and discuss the relationship of this phenotype to alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Methods: The patients’ DNA underwent next generation sequencing. A retrospective analysis of clinical case records is reported. Results: Each of the three patients had an unreported heterozygous de novo sequence variant in ATP1A3. These patients shared a similar phenotype characterized by early-onset attacks of movement disorders, some of which proved to be epileptic, and severe developmental delay. (Hemi)plegic attacks had not been considered before genetic testing. Significance: Together with the two previously reported cases, our patients confirm that ATP1A3 mutations are associated with a phenotype combining features of early-onset encephalopathy, epilepsy and dystonic fits, as in the most severe forms of alternating hemiplegia of childhood, but in which (hemi)plegic attacks are absent or only suspected retrospectively.', 'Neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamus: A distinct form of structural plasticity involved in metabolic and circadian regulation, with potential relevance for human pathophysiology. The adult brain harbors specific niches where stem cells undergo substantial plasticity and, in some regions, generate new neurons throughout life. This phenomenon is well known in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and has recently also been described in the hypothalamus of several rodent and primate species. After a brief overview of preclinical studies illustrating the pathophysiologic significance of hypothalamic neurogenesis in the control of energy metabolism, reproduction, thermoregulation, sleep, and aging, we review current literature on the neurogenic niche of the human hypothalamus. A comparison of the organization of the niche between humans and rodents highlights some common features, but also substantial differences, e.g., in the distribution and extent of the hypothalamic neural stem cells. Exploring the full dynamics of hypothalamic neurogenesis in humans raises a formidable challenge however, given among others, inherent technical limitations. We close with discussing possible functional role(s) of the human hypothalamic niche, and how gaining more insights into this form of plasticity could be relevant for a better understanding of pathologies associated with disturbed hypothalamic function.', 'What is the evidence that tau pathology spreads through prion-like propagation?. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that the spread of tau pathology in the brain in Tauopathies reflects the propagation of abnormal tau species along neuroanatomically connected brain areas. This propagation could occur through a \"prion-like\" mechanism involving transfer of abnormal tau seeds from a \"donor cell\" to a \"recipient cell\" and recruitment of normal tau in the latter to generate new tau seeds. This review critically appraises the evidence that the spread of tau pathology occurs via such a \"prion-like\" mechanism and proposes a number of recommendations for directing future research. Recommendations for definitions of frequently used terms in the tau field are presented in an attempt to clarify and standardize interpretation of research findings. Molecular and cellular factors affecting tau aggregation are briefly reviewed, as are potential contributions of physiological and pathological post-translational modifications of tau. Additionally, the experimental evidence for tau seeding and \"prion-like\" propagation of tau aggregation that has emerged from cellular assays and in vivo models is discussed. Propagation of tau pathology using \"prion-like\" mechanisms is expected to incorporate several steps including cellular uptake, templated seeding, secretion and intercellular transfer through synaptic and non-synaptic pathways. The experimental findings supporting each of these steps are reviewed. The clinical validity of these experimental findings is then debated by considering the supportive or contradictory findings from patient samples. Further, the role of physiological tau release in this scenario is examined because emerging data shows that tau is secreted but the physiological function (if any) of this secretion in the context of propagation of pathological tau seeds is unclear. Bona fide prions exhibit specific properties, including transmission from cell to cell, tissue to tissue and organism to organism. The propagation of tau pathology has so far not been shown to exhibit all of these steps and how this influences the debate of whether or not abnormal tau species can propagate in a \"prion-like\" manner is discussed. The exact nature of tau seeds responsible for propagation of tau pathology in human tauopathies remains controversial; it might be tightly linked to the existence of tau strains stably propagating peculiar patterns of neuropathological lesions, corresponding to the different patterns seen in human tauopathies. That this is a property shared by all seed-competent tau conformers is not yet firmly established. Further investigation is also required to clarify the relationship between propagation of tau aggregates and tau-induced toxicity. Genetic variants identified as risks factors for tauopathies might play a role in propagation of tau pathology, but many more studies are needed to document this. The contribution of selective vulnerability of neuronal populations, as an alternative to prion-like mechanisms to explain spreading of tau pathology needs to be clarified. Learning from the prion field will be helpful to enhance our understanding of propagation of tau pathology. Finally, development of better models is expected to answer some of these key questions and allow for the testing of propagation-centred therapies.', 'Neutrophil adhesion in brain capillaries reduces cortical blood flow and impairs memory function in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions in Alzheimer’s disease patients and related mouse models have been recognized for decades, but the underlying mechanisms and resulting consequences for Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice we found that an increased number of cortical capillaries had stalled blood flow as compared to in wild-type animals, largely due to neutrophils that had adhered in capillary segments and blocked blood flow. Administration of antibodies against the neutrophil marker Ly6G reduced the number of stalled capillaries, leading to both an immediate increase in CBF and rapidly improved performance in spatial and working memory tasks. This study identified a previously uncharacterized cellular mechanism that explains the majority of the CBF reduction seen in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and demonstrated that improving CBF rapidly enhanced short-term memory function. Restoring cerebral perfusion by preventing neutrophil adhesion may provide a strategy for improving cognition in Alzheimer’s disease patients.', 'HIV-1 escape in the central nervous system on elvitegravir-based antiretroviral therapy.

The complementation group F of Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-F) is rare in the Caucasian population, and usually devoid of neurological symptoms. We report two cases, both Caucasian, who exhibited progressive cerebellar ataxia, chorea, a mild subcortical frontal cognitive impairment, and in one case severe polyneuropathy. Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar (2/2) and cortical (1/2) atrophy. Both patients had only mild sunburn sensitivity and no skin cancer. Mini-exome sequencing approach revealed in ERCC4, two heterozygous mutations, one of which was never described (c.580–584\\xa0+\\xa01delCCAAGG, exon 3), in the first case, and an already reported homozygous mutation, in the second case. These cases emphasize that XP-F is a rare cause of recessive cerebellar ataxia and can in some cases clinically mimic Huntington's disease due to chorea and executive impairment. The association of ataxia, chorea, and sun hypersensitivity are major guidance for the diagnosis, which should not be missed, in order to prevent skin neoplastic complications.\", \"Covid-19 Infection and Parkinsonism: Is There a Link?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an opportunistic pathogen that infects the upper respiratory tract in humans and causes serious illness, including fatal pneumonia and neurological disorders. Several studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 may worsen the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), with the potential to increase mortality rates in patients with advanced disease. The potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 to induce PD has also been suggested because the virus can enter the brain, where it can trigger cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration. In this review, we will discuss the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to exacerbate and cause certain neurological disorders, including PD. We will then elucidate its impact on the brain while examining its pathways and mechanisms of action. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\", 'Influence of different isoflurane anesthesia protocols on murine cerebral hemodynamics measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling. Arterial spin labeling (ASL)-MRI can noninvasively map cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment and dementia. Mouse models of disease are frequently used in translational MRI studies, which are commonly performed under anesthesia. Understanding the influence of the specific anesthesia protocol used on the measured parameters is important for accurate interpretation of hemodynamic studies with mice. Isoflurane is a frequently used anesthetic with vasodilative properties. Here, the influence of three distinct isoflurane protocols was studied with pseudo-continuous ASL in two different mouse strains. The first protocol was a free-breathing set-up with medium concentrations, the second a free-breathing set-up with low induction and maintenance concentrations, and the third a set-up with medium concentrations and mechanical ventilation. A protocol with the vasoconstrictive anesthetic medetomidine was used as a comparison. As expected, medium isoflurane anesthesia resulted in significantly higher CBF and lower CVR values than medetomidine (median whole-brain CBF of 157.7 vs 84.4\\xa0mL/100\\xa0g/min and CVR of 0.54 vs 51.7% in C57BL/6\\xa0J mice). The other two isoflurane protocols lowered the CBF and increased the CVR values compared with medium isoflurane anesthesia, without obvious differences between them (median whole-brain CBF of 138.9 vs 131.7\\xa0mL/100\\xa0g/min and CVR of 10.0 vs 9.6%, in C57BL/6\\xa0J mice). Furthermore, CVR was shown to be dependent on baseline CBF, regardless of the anesthesia protocol used.', 'Five years of ocrelizumab in relapsing multiple sclerosis: OPERA studies open-label extension. OBJECTIVE: To assess over 3 years of follow-up the effects of maintaining or switching to ocrelizumab (OCR) therapy on clinical and MRI outcomes and safety measures in the open-label extension (OLE) phase of the pooled OPERA: I/II studies in relapsing multiple sclerosis. METHODS: After 2 years of double-blind, controlled treatment, patients continued OCR (600 mg infusions every 24 weeks) or switched from interferon (IFN)-β-1a (44 μg 3 times weekly) to OCR when entering the OLE phase (3 years). Adjusted annualized relapse rate, time to onset of 24-week confirmed disability progression (CDP)/improvement (CDP), brain MRI activity (gadolinium-enhanced and new/enlarging T2 lesions), and percentage brain volume change were analyzed. RESULTS: Of patients entering the OLE phase, 88.6% completed year 5. The cumulative proportion with 24-week CDP was lower in patients who initiated OCR earlier vs patients initially receiving IFN-β-1a (16.1% vs 21.3% at year 5; p = 0.014). Patients continuing OCR maintained and those switching from IFN-β-1a to OCR attained near complete and sustained suppression of new brain MRI lesion activity from years 3-5. Over the OLE phase, patients continuing OCR exhibited less whole brain volume loss from double-blind study baseline vs those switching from IFN-β-1a (-1.87% vs -2.15% at year 5; p < 0.01). Adverse events were consistent with past reports and no new safety signals emerged with prolonged treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared with patients switching from IFN-β-1a, earlier and continuous OCR treatment up to 5 years provided sustained benefit on clinical and MRI measures of disease progression. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that earlier and continuous treatment with OCR provided sustained benefit on clinical and MRI outcomes of disease activity and progression compared with patients switching from IFN-β-1a. The study is rated Class III because of the initial treatment randomization disclosure that occurred after inclusion in OLE.

Sequencing of the honeybee genome revealed many neuropeptides and putative neuropeptide receptors, yet functional characterization of these peptidic systems is scarce. In this study, we focus on allatostatins, which were first identified as inhibitors of juvenile hormone synthesis, but whose role in the adult honey bee (Apis mellifera) brain remains to be determined. We characterize the bee allatostatin system, represented by two families: allatostatin A (Apime-ASTA) and its receptor (Apime-ASTA-R); and C-type allatostatins (Apime-ASTC and Apime-ASTCC) and their common receptor (Apime-ASTC-R). Apime-ASTA-R and Apime-ASTC-R are the receptors in bees most closely related to vertebrate galanin and somatostatin receptors, respectively. We examine the functional properties of the two honeybee receptors and show that they are transcriptionally expressed in the adult brain, including in brain centers known to be important for learning and memory processes. Thus we investigated the effects of exogenously applied allatostatins on appetitive olfactory learning in the bee. Our results show that allatostatins modulate learning in this insect, and provide important insights into the evolution of somatostatin/allatostatin signaling.', 'EEG-BIDS, an extension to the brain imaging data structure for electroencephalography. ', 'EEG Neurofeedback for Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders: A Blueprint for a Promising Brain-Based Therapy. Purpose of Review: This review provides an overview of current knowledge and understanding of EEG neurofeedback for anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. Recent Findings: The manifestations of anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) are associated with dysfunctions of neurophysiological stress axes and brain arousal circuits, which are important dimensions of the research domain criteria (RDoC). Even if the pathophysiology of these disorders is complex, one of its defining signatures is behavioral and physiological over-arousal. Interestingly, arousal-related brain activity can be modulated by electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback (EEG NF), a non-pharmacological and non-invasive method that involves neurocognitive training through a brain–computer interface (BCI). EEG NF is characterized by a simultaneous learning process where both patient and computer are involved in modifying neuronal activity or connectivity, thereby improving associated symptoms of anxiety and/or over-arousal. Summary: Positive effects of EEG NF have been described for both anxiety disorders and PTSD, yet due to a number of methodological issues, it remains unclear whether symptom improvement is the direct result of neurophysiological changes targeted by EEG NF. Thus, in this work we sought to bridge current knowledge on brain mechanisms of arousal with past and present EEG NF therapies for anxiety and PTSD. In a nutshell, we discuss the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of EEG NF in anxiety disorder and PTSD, the methodological strengths/weaknesses of existing EEG NF randomized controlled trials for these disorders, and the neuropsychological factors that may impact NF training success.', 'Relationship between brain plasticity, learning and foraging performance in honey bees. Brain structure and learning capacities both vary with experience, but the mechanistic link between them is unclear. Here, we investigated whether experience-dependent variability in learning performance can be explained by neuroplasticity in foraging honey bees. The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a brain center necessary for ambiguous olfactory learning tasks such as reversal learning. Using radio frequency identification technology, we assessed the effects of natural variation in foraging activity, and the age when first foraging, on both performance in reversal learning and on synaptic connectivity in the MBs. We found that reversal learning performance improved at foraging onset and could decline with greater foraging experience. If bees started foraging before the normal age, as a result of a stress applied to the colony, the decline in learning performance with foraging experience was more severe. Analyses of brain structure in the same bees showed that the total number of synaptic boutons at the MB input decreased when bees started foraging, and then increased with greater foraging intensity. At foraging onset MB structure is therefore optimized for bees to update learned information, but optimization of MB connectivity deteriorates with foraging effort. In a computational model of the MBs sparser coding of information at the MB input improved reversal learning performance. We propose, therefore, a plausible mechanistic relationship between experience, neuroplasticity, and cognitive performance in a natural and ecological context.', 'Brain–liver axis: a new pathway for cognitive disorders related to hepatic fibrosis. ', 'The clinical-phenotype continuum in DYNC1H1-related disorders—genomic profiling and proposal for a novel classification. Mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain gene (DYNC1H1) have been identified in rare neuromuscular (NMD) and neurodevelopmental (NDD) disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity dominance (SMALED) and autosomal dominant mental retardation syndrome 13 (MRD13). Phenotypes and genotypes of ten pediatric patients with pathogenic DYNC1H1 variants were analyzed in a multi-center study. Data mining of large-scale genomic variant databases was used to investigate domain-specific vulnerability and conservation of DYNC1H1. We identified ten patients with nine novel mutations in the DYNC1H1 gene. These patients exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical findings, suggesting an overlapping disease manifestation with intermixed phenotypes ranging from neuropathy (peripheral nervous system, PNS) to severe intellectual disability (central nervous system, CNS). Genomic profiling of healthy and patient variant datasets underlines the domain-specific effects of genetic variation in DYNC1H1, specifically on toleration towards missense variants in the linker domain. A retrospective analysis of all published mutations revealed domain-specific genotype–phenotype correlations, i.e., mutations in the dimerization domain with reductions in lower limb strength in DYNC1H1–NMD and motor domain with cerebral malformations in DYNC1H1–NDD. We highlight that the current classification into distinct disease entities does not sufficiently reflect the clinical disease manifestation that clinicians face in the diagnostic work-up of DYNC1H1-related disorders. We propose a novel clinical classification for DYNC1H1-related disorders encompassing a spectrum from DYNC1H1–NMD with an exclusive PNS phenotype to DYNC1H1–NDD with concomitant CNS involvement.', 'Marmoset brain segmentation from deconvolved magnetic resonance images and estimated label maps. Purpose: The proposed method aims to create label maps that can be used for the segmentation of animal brain MR images without the need of a brain template. This is achieved by performing a joint deconvolution and segmentation of the brain MR images. Methods: It is based on modeling locally the image statistics using a generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) and couples the deconvolved image and its corresponding labels map using the GGD-Potts model. Because of the complexity of the resulting Bayesian estimators of the unknown model parameters, a Gibbs sampler is used to generate samples following the desired posterior probability. Results: The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on simulated and real MR images by the segmentation of enhanced marmoset brain images into its main compartments using the corresponding label maps created. Quantitative assessment showed that this method presents results that are comparable to those obtained with the classical method—registering the volumes to a brain template. Conclusion: The proposed method of using labels as prior information for brain segmentation provides a similar or a slightly better performance compared with the classical reference method based on a dedicated template.', 'BIN1 recovers tauopathy-induced long-term memory deficits in mice and interacts with Tau through Thr<sup>348</sup> phosphorylation. The bridging integrator 1 gene (BIN1) is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this report, we investigated how BIN1-dependent pathophysiological processes might be associated with Tau. We first generated a cohort of control and transgenic mice either overexpressing human MAPT (TgMAPT) or both human MAPT and BIN1 (TgMAPT;TgBIN1), which we followed-up from 3 to 15\\xa0months. In TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice short-term memory deficits appeared earlier than in TgMAPT mice; however—unlike TgMAPT mice—TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice did not exhibit any long-term or spatial memory deficits for at least 15\\xa0months. After killing the cohort at 18\\xa0months, immunohistochemistry revealed that BIN1 overexpression prevents both Tau mislocalization and somatic inclusion in the hippocampus, where an increase in BIN1–Tau interaction was also observed. We then sought mechanisms controlling the BIN1–Tau interaction. We developed a high-content screening approach to characterize modulators of the BIN1–Tau interaction in an agnostic way (1,126 compounds targeting multiple pathways), and we identified—among others—an inhibitor of calcineurin, a Ser/Thr phosphatase. We determined that calcineurin dephosphorylates BIN1 on a cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site at T348, promoting the open conformation of the neuronal BIN1 isoform. Phosphorylation of this site increases the availability of the BIN1 SH3 domain for Tau interaction, as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and in primary neurons. Finally, we observed that although the levels of the neuronal BIN1 isoform were unchanged in AD brains, phospho-BIN1(T348):BIN1 ratio was increased, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. In conclusion, our data support the idea that BIN1 modulates the AD risk through an intricate regulation of its interaction with Tau. Alteration in BIN1 expression or activity may disrupt this regulatory balance with Tau and have direct effects on learning and memory.', 'Cerebral and Muscle Oxygenation during Repeated Shuttle Run Sprints with Hypoventilation. Ten highly-trained Jiu-Jitsu fighters performed 2 repeated-sprint sessions, each including 2 sets of 8 x ~6 s back-and-forth running sprints on a tatami. One session was carried out with normal breathing (RSN) and the other with voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL). Prefrontal and vastus lateralis muscle oxyhemoglobin ([O 2 Hb]) and deoxyhemoglobin ([HHb]) were monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), heart rate (HR), gas exchange and maximal blood lactate concentration ([La] max) were also assessed. SpO 2 was significantly lower in RSH-VHL than in RSN whereas there was no difference in HR. Muscle oxygenation was not different between conditions during the entire exercise. On the other hand, in RSH-VHL, cerebral oxygenation was significantly lower than in RSN (-6.1±5.4 vs-1.5±6.6 μm). Oxygen uptake was also higher during the recovery periods whereas [La] max tended to be lower in RSH-VHL. The time of the sprints was not different between conditions. This study shows that repeated shuttle-run sprints with VHL has a limited impact on muscle deoxygenation but induces a greater fall in cerebral oxygenation compared with normal breathing conditions. Despite this phenomenon, performance is not impaired, probably because of a higher oxygen uptake during the recovery periods following sprints.', \"Constrained Tensor Decomposition for Longitudinal Analysis of Diffusion Imaging Data. Analysis of complex data is still a challenge in medical image analysis. Due to the heterogeneous information that can be extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) it can be difficult to fuse such data in a proper way. One interesting case is given by the analysis of diffusion imaging (DI) data. DI techniques give an important variety of information about the status of microstructure in the brain. This is interesting information to use especially in longitudinal setting where the temporal evolution of the pathology is an important added value. In this paper, we propose a new tensor-based framework capable to detect longitudinal changes appearing in DI data in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We focus our attention to the analysis of longitudinal changes occurring along different white matter (WM) fiber-bundles. Our main goal is to detect which subset of fibers (within a bundle) and which sections of these fibers contain 'pathological' longitudinal changes. The framework consists of three main parts: i) preprocessing of longitudinal diffusion acquisitions and WM fiber-bundles extraction, ii) data tensorization and rank selection, iii) application of a parallelized constrained tensor factorization algorithm to detect longitudinal 'pathological' changes. The proposed method was applied on simulated longitudinal variations and on real MS data. High level of accuracy and precision were obtained in the detection of small longitudinal changes along the WM fiber-bundles.\", 'Ultrasound stress compromises the correlates of emotional-like states and brain AMPAR expression in mice: effects of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory herbal treatment. The modern lifestyle is associated with exposure to “psychological” or “emotional” stress. A growing portion of the population is exposed to emotional stress that results in a high incidence of anxiety disorders, a serious social problem. With this rise, there is a need for understanding the neurobiological causes of stress-induced anxiety and to offer safe remedies for this condition. Side effects of existing pharmaceuticals necessitate the search for alternatives. Having fewer adverse effects than classic remedies, natural extract-based therapies can be a promising solution. Here, we applied a model of emotional stress in BALB/c mice using ultrasound exposure to evoke the signs of anxiety-like behavior. We examined the behavioral and molecular impact of ultrasound and administration of herbal antioxidant/anti-inflammatory treatment (HAT) on AMPA receptor expression, markers of plasticity, inflammation and oxidative stress. A 3-week ultrasound exposure increased scores of anxiety-like behaviors in the standard tests and altered hippocampal expression as well as internalization of AMPA receptor subunits GluA1-A3. Concomitant treatment with HAT has prevented increases of anxiety-like behaviors and other behavioral changes, normalized hippocampal malondialdehyde content, GSK3β and pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1β and Il-6, and the number of Ki67-positive cells. Levels of malondialdehyde, a common measure of oxidative stress, significantly correlated with the investigated end-points in stressed, but not in non-stressed animals. Our results emphasize the role of oxidative stress in neurobiological abnormalities associated with experimentally induced condition mimicking emotional stress in rodents and highlight the potential therapeutic use of anti-oxidants like herbal compositions for management of stress-related emotional disturbances within the community.', \"Clusterin/Apolipoprotein J immunoreactivity is associated with white matter damage in cerebral small vessel diseases. Aim: Brain clusterin is known to be associated with the amyloid-β deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed the distribution of clusterin immunoreactivity in cerebrovascular disorders, particularly focusing on white matter changes in small vessel diseases. Methods: Post-mortem brain tissues from the frontal or temporal lobes of a total of 70 subjects with various disorders including cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and AD were examined using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We further used immunogold electron microscopy to study clusterin immunoreactivity in extracellular deposits in CADASIL. Results: Immunostaining with clusterin antibodies revealed strong localization in arterioles and capillaries, besides cortical neurones. We found that clusterin immunostaining was significantly increased in the frontal white matter of CADASIL and pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy subjects. In addition, clusterin immunostaining correlated with white matter pathology severity scores. Immunostaining in axons ranged from fine punctate deposits in single axons to larger confluent areas with numerous swollen axon bulbs, similar to that observed with known axon damage markers such as non-phosphorylated neurofilament H and the amyloid precursor protein. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy experiments showed that whereas clusterin immunoreactivity was closely associated with vascular amyloid-β in CAA, it was lacking within the granular osmiophilic material immunolabelled by NOTCH3 extracelluar domain aggregates found in CADASIL. Conclusions: Our results suggest a wider role for clusterin associated with white matter damage in addition to its ability to chaperone proteins for clearance via the perivascular drainage pathways in several disease states.\", 'Critical appraisal of STAT3 pattern in adult cardiomyocytes. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3, transfers cellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, acting as a signaling molecule and a transcription factor. Reports proposed an additional non-canonical role of STAT3 that could regulate the activity of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP)after ischemia-reperfusion in various cell types. The native expression of STAT3 in heart mitochondria, together with a direct versus an indirect transcriptional role in mitochondrial functions, have been recently questioned. The objective of the present study was to investigate the cellular distribution of STAT3 in mouse adult cardiomyocytes under basal and stress conditions, along with assessing its presence and activity in cardiac mitochondria using structural and functional approaches. The analysis of the spatial distribution of STAT3 signal in the cardiomyocytes interestingly showed that it is transversely distributed along the T-tubules and in the nucleus. This distribution was neither affected by hypoxia nor by hypoxia/re‑oxygenation conditions. Focusing on the mitochondrial STAT3 localization, our results suggest that serine-phosphorylated STAT3 (PS727-STAT3)and total STAT3 are detected in crude but not in pure mitochondria of mouse adult cardiomyocytes, under basal and ischemia-reperfusion conditions. The inhibition of STAT3, with a pre-validated non-toxic Stattic dose, had no significant effects on mitochondrial respiration, but a weak effect on the calcium retention capacity. Overall, our results exclusively reveal a unique cellular distribution of STAT3 in mouse adult cardiomyocytes, along the T-tubules and in nucleus, under different conditions. They also challenge the expression and activity of STAT3 in mitochondria of these cells under basal conditions and following ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, our results underline technical methods, complemental to cell fractionation, to evaluate STAT3 roles during hypoxia-reoxygenation and at the interface between nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum.', 'Association of systemic secondary brain insults and outcome in patients with convulsive status epilepticus A post hoc study of a randomized controlled trial. Objective To evaluate the association between systemic factors (mean arterial blood pressure, arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen, body temperature, natremia, and glycemia) on day 1 and neurologic outcomes 90 days after convulsive status epilepticus. Methods This was a post hoc analysis of the Evaluation of Therapeutic Hypothermia in Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Adults in Intensive Care (HYBERNATUS) multicenter open-label controlled trial, which randomized 270 critically ill patients with convulsive status epilepticus requiring mechanical ventilation to therapeutic hypothermia (32°C-34°C for 24 hours) plus standard care or standard care alone between March 2011 and January 2015. The primary endpoint was a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5, defining a favorable outcome, 90 days after convulsive status epilepticus. Results The 172 men and 93 women had a median age of 57 years (45-68 years). Among them, 130 (49%) had a history of epilepsy, and 59 (29%) had a primary brain insult. Convulsive status epilepticus was refractory in 86 (32%) patients, and total seizure duration was 67 minutes (35-120 minutes). The 90-day outcome was unfavorable in 126 (48%) patients. In multivariate analysis, none of the systemic secondary brain insults were associated with outcome; achieving an unfavorable outcome was associated with age >65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-3.85; p = 0.01), refractory convulsive status epilepticus (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.04-3.85; p = 0.04), primary brain insult (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.02-4.00; p = 0.047), and no bystander-witnessed seizure onset (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.05-5.59; p = 0.04). Conclusions In our population, systemic secondary brain insults were not associated with outcome in critically ill patients with convulsive status epilepticus.', 'Multidomain interventions: state-of-the-art and future directions for protocols to implement precision dementia risk reduction. A user manual for Brain Health Services—part 4 of 6. Although prevention of dementia and late-life cognitive decline is a major public health priority, there are currently no generally established prevention strategies or operational models for implementing such strategies into practice. This article is a narrative review of available evidence from multidomain dementia prevention trials targeting several risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously, in individuals without dementia at baseline. Based on the findings, we formulate recommendations for implementing precision risk reduction strategies into new services called Brain Health Services. A literature search was conducted using medical databases (MEDLINE via PubMed and SCOPUS) to select relevant studies: non-pharmacological multidomain interventions (i.e., combining two or more intervention domains), target population including individuals without dementia, and primary outcomes including cognitive/functional performance changes and/or incident cognitive impairment or dementia. Further literature searches covered the following topics: sub-group analyses assessing potential modifiers for the intervention effect on cognition in the multidomain prevention trials, dementia risk scores used as surrogate outcomes in multidomain prevention trials, dementia risk scores in relation to brain pathology markers, and cardiovascular risk scores in relation to dementia. Multidomain intervention studies conducted so far appear to have mixed results and substantial variability in target populations, format and intensity of interventions, choice of control conditions, and outcome measures. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries. The differences in design between the larger, longer-term trials that met vs. did not meet their primary outcomes suggest that multidomain intervention effectiveness may be dependent on a precision prevention approach, i.e., successfully identifying the at-risk groups who are most likely to benefit. One such successful trial has already developed an operational model for implementing the intervention into practice. Evidence on the efficacy of risk reduction interventions is promising, but not yet conclusive. More long-term multidomain randomized controlled trials are needed to fill the current evidence gaps, especially concerning low- and middle-income countries and integration of dementia prevention with existing cerebrovascular prevention programs. A precision risk reduction approach may be most effective for dementia prevention. Such an approach could be implemented in Brain Health Services.', \"Direct Evidence of the Presence of Cross-Linked Aβ Dimers in the Brains of Alzheimer's Disease Patients. Brain-derived amyloid-β (Aβ) dimers are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their covalent nature remains controversial. This feature is relevant, as a covalent cross-link has been proposed to make brain-derived dimers (brain dimers) more synaptotoxic than Aβ monomers and would also make them suitable candidates for biomarker development. To resolve this controversy, we here present a three-step approach. First, we validated a type of synthetic cross-linked Aβ (CL Aβ) dimers, obtained by means of the photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) reaction, as well-defined mimics of putative brain CL Aβ dimers. Second, we used these PICUP CL Aβ dimers as standards to improve the isolation of brain Aβ dimers and to develop state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) strategies to allow their characterization. Third, we applied these MS methods to the analysis of brain Aβ dimer samples allowing the detection of the CL [Aβ(6-16)]2 peptide comprising a dityrosine cross-link. This result demonstrates the presence of CL Aβ dimers in the brains of patients with AD and opens up avenues for establishing new therapeutic targets and developing novel biomarkers for this disease.\", 'The Influence of Stroke Location on Cognitive and Mood Impairment. A Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping Study. Background and purpose: The role of stroke location as a determinant of mood and cognitive symptoms is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to identify the predictive value of ischemic stroke location, on a voxel basis, for mood and cognitive outcome. Materials and methods: A prospective monocentric study including patients with a supratentorial ischemic stroke was conducted. A 3 Tesla brain MRI was performed at baseline. Mood and cognition were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), apathy inventory (AI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale subscores, performed at 3 months poststroke. Statistical maps of ischemic stroke location associated with 3 months mood and cognitive scores were obtained using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach (Brunner and Munzel test). Significant voxels (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected-P <.01) were identified using the standard Montreal Neurological Institute-152 space template. Results: Two hundred and sixty-five nonsevere stroke patients were included (64% men, mean age 66 ± 14, median National Institute of Health Stroke Score 3, interquartile range 2-6). Ischemic stroke location was not associated with HAD or AI scores. Language, abstraction, and delayed recall performances were mainly associated with left-side hemispheric lesions. Lesions in both hemispheres were associated with lower performances in visuospatial and executive functions, naming, attention, and orientation. Conclusion: Ischemic stroke location does not predict mood outcome at 3 months but is a determinant of cognitive outcome in specific domains.', 'Astroglial type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<inf>1</inf>): A new player in the tripartite synapse. The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of physiological functions. In the brain, this control is mainly exerted through the type-1-cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors are abundant at neuron terminals where their stimulation inhibits neurotransmitter release. However, CB1 receptors are also expressed in astrocytes and recent studies showed that astroglial cannabinoid signaling is a key element of the tripartite synapse. In this review we discuss the different mechanisms by which astroglial CB1 receptors control synaptic transmission and plasticity. The recent involvement of astroglial CB1 receptors in the effects of cannabinoids on memory highlights their key roles in cognitive processes and further indicates that astrocytes are central active elements of high-order brain functions.', 'Brain MRI after therapeutic hypothermia in asphyxiated newborns: Predictive value at one year of imaging features. Purpose: To compare early brain MRI using a composite imaging score and outcome at one year in asphyxiated newborns treated by hypothermia. Methods: This retrospective study included for two years consecutive asphyxiated term newborns treated by hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and who had brain MRI before day 8. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated within the first 6 h of life and continued for 72 h. Imaging protocol included T1 and T2 sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), evaluated with a specific composite score, and spectroscopy. Clinical evaluation was performed at one year of age, outcome was classified as favorable/unfavorable. The primary endpoint was the correlation between our MRI score and outcome with the definition of a threshold. The secondary endpoints were to find the most relevant criteria within the score and to evaluate objective signal measurements to support subjective criteria. Results: Among the 33 included patients, 9 died during the first days of life, 20 had a favorable outcome, 4 an unfavorable one. MRI score was correlated to a poor clinical outcome (p < 0.001). Most of the criteria within the score and spectroscopy results were relevant (p < 0.05). Cerebral edema was objectively assessed by the signal intensity ratio of white matter compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on T2-weighted images (p < 0.001). Conclusion: MRI score was predictive of neurodevelopmental outcome at one year. The most relevant criteria within the score were DWI abnormalities in basal ganglia and thalami and loss of white-cortical grey matter differentiation. Signal intensity ratio between white matter and CSF higher than 0.75 supports the presence of edema.', 'Hodology of the superior longitudinal system of the human brain: a historical perspective, the current controversies, and a proposal. The description of human white matter pathways experienced a tremendous improvement, thanks to the advancement of neuroimaging and dissection techniques. The downside of this progress is the production of redundant and conflicting literature, bound by specific studies’ methods and aims. The Superior Longitudinal System (SLS), encompassing the arcuate (AF) and the superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF), becomes an illustrative example of this fundamental issue, being one of the most studied white matter association pathways of the brain. Herein, we provide a complete illustration of this white matter fiber system’s current definition, from its early descriptions in the nineteenth century to its most recent characterizations. We propose a review of both in vivo diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-based tractography and anatomical dissection studies, enclosing all the information available up to date. Based on these findings, we reconstruct the wiring diagram of the SLS, highlighting a substantial variability in the description of its cortical sites of termination and the taxonomy and partonomy that characterize the system. We aim to level up discrepancies in the literature by proposing a parallel across the various nomenclature. Consistent with the topographical arrangement already documented for commissural and projection pathways, we suggest approaching the SLS organization as an orderly and continuous wiring diagram, respecting a medio-lateral palisading topography between the different frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal gyri rather than in terms of individualized fascicles. A better and complete description of the fine organization of white matter association pathways’ connectivity is fundamental for a better understanding of brain function and their clinical and neurosurgical applications.', 'Mitochondria and the Brain: Bioenergetics and Beyond. The view of mitochondria acting solely as a powerhouse of the cell is no longer accurate. Besides cell bioenergetics, primary targets of mitochondrial studies include their interplay with essential processes within the cell, including redox and calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Recent studies evidence the dynamic behavior of mitochondria, continuously moving, fusing, and dividing, and the interaction of these events with cellular degeneration and plasticity in neural cells. Our review summarizes novel data and technologies that are developed and applied to the identification and clarification of the mitochondrial role in neural plasticity using both cultured cells and in vivo approaches. The complete understanding and modulation of such mechanisms may represent a novel and promising therapeutic approach for treatment of diseases affecting central and peripheral nervous system.', 'Dopaminergic denervation using [ <sup>123</sup> I]-FPCIT and pain in Parkinson’s disease: a correlation study. In patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), abnormal activations of nociceptive brain areas and lowered pain thresholds were reported, probably reflecting a central modification of pain processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the striatal and extrastriatal dopaminergic system and pain threshold in PD patients. We included 25 PD patients with various intensities of central pain (visual analog scale). Subjective pain threshold (thermotest) and a motor examination (UPDRS III) were performed. Patients underwent SPECT imaging with [ 123 I]-FP-CIT. We analyzed the correlation between [ 123 I]-FP-CIT binding and subjective pain threshold, using a simple linear regression model for striatal uptake and a voxel-based approach for extrastriatal uptake. The covariables were age, sex, duration of PD, and UPDRS motor score. A pain matrix mask was also used to identify clusters in relation with pain matrix. Striatal analysis revealed that [ 123 I]-FP-CIT binding was negatively correlated with age (p = 0.02), duration of PD (p = 0.0002) and UPDRS motor score (p = 0.006), but no correlation with pain threshold was observed. The extrastriatal analysis showed a positive correlation between [ 123 I]-FP-CIT binding and subjective heat pain threshold for the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p < 0.001) and negative correlations for the right secondary visual cortex (p < 0.001) and left insula (p < 0.001). When applying the pain matrix mask, correlations remained significant only in the left PCC and the left insula. We suggest that pain perception abnormalities in PD are not directly related to striatal dopaminergic dysfunction. Painful sensations may be related to extrastriatal monoaminergic systems.', 'Immunopathological characterization of ovarian teratomas associated with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Encephalitis with anti-NMDAR antibodies (NMDAR-E) is a severe autoimmune neurological disorder, defined by a clinical presentation of encephalitis and the presence of IgG targeting the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the CSF. An underlying ovarian teratoma is commonly associated with this autoimmune disease suggesting a role of the tumor in immunopathogenesis. In this study, we characterized the salient histopathological features of 27 ovarian teratomas associated with NMDAR-E (3 immature and 24 mature teratomas) and 40 controls without associated encephalitis. All but one NMDAR-E-associated teratomas contained a nervous tissue component, while less than 40% of control teratomas did (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). GluN1 expression by teratomatous nervous tissue seemed to be more often glial in NMDAR-E teratomas than in control teratomas (73% vs. 29%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Strikingly, 3 out of 24 NMDAR-E-associated mature teratomas contained neuroglial tissue exhibiting histopathological features of central nervous system neuroglial tumor, while such glioma-like features are exceptionally described in the literature on ovarian teratomas. Moreover, NMDAR-E associated teratomas differed from sporadic ovarian teratomas by consistent and prominent infiltration of the nervous tissue component by immune cells, comprised of T- and B-cells and mature dendritic cells organized in tertiary lymphoid structures, with IgG and IgA deposits and plasma cells in close contact to the neuroglial tissue.These data demonstrate an association between massive infiltration of NMDAR-E-associated teratomas by immune cells and particular glial features of its neuroglial component, suggesting that this glial tissue might be involved in triggering or sustaining the anti-tumor response associated with the auto-immune neurological disease.', 'De Novo SOX6 Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Associated with ADHD, Craniosynostosis, and Osteochondromas. SOX6 belongs to a family of 20 SRY-related HMG-box-containing (SOX) genes that encode transcription factors controlling cell fate and differentiation in many developmental and adult processes. For SOX6, these processes include, but are not limited to, neurogenesis and skeletogenesis. Variants in half of the SOX genes have been shown to cause severe developmental and adult syndromes, referred to as SOXopathies. We here provide evidence that SOX6 variants also cause a SOXopathy. Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families. Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas. All variants are heterozygous. Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant. Intragenic microdeletions, balanced structural rearrangements, frameshifts, and nonsense variants are predicted to inactivate the SOX6 variant allele. Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily. These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging. Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in vitro. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found. Taken together, these findings concur that SOX6 haploinsufficiency leads to a neurodevelopmental SOXopathy that often includes ADHD and abnormal skeletal and other features.', 'A framework for disentangling the hyperbolic truth of neurofeedback: Comment on Thibault and Raz (2017). In this comment, we propose a theoretical framework for disentangling the potentially multiple elements driving the effects of electroencephalogram (EEG)-neurofeedback (EEG-nf) to clarify the roadmap for research in the field. Three questions are identified: (a) Do EEG-nf effects originate from a placebo effect related to the technological environment of a neurofeedback session? (b) Do EEG-nf effects originate from a nonspecific effect of cognitive brain training during neurofeedback? If so, a cognitive training would be underpinned by the brain activity regulation loop but this training would not be specifically related to the neurophysiological biomarker chosen. (c) Do EEG-nf effects originate from a specific effect of cognitive brain training? If so, the effects of EEG-nf would be explained by the training of the specific neurophysiological biomarker chosen, depending on the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of the disorder. The proposed framework might thus allow to understand to what degree each of these level contribute to the effects of EEG-nf on the brain and behavior in view of the psychosocial variables involved.', \"Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) arises in people who have a genetic susceptibility to environmental factors and events, which ultimately trigger the disease. It is thought that peripheral immune cells are mobilized and enter the CNS through the impaired blood–brain barrier in the subarachnoid space, as acute lesions show large numbers of macrophages and CD8+ T cells and, to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells, B cells and plasma cells. Demyelination is mostly localized to focal lesions in early relapsing–remitting (RR) MS, whereas other areas of white matter appear normal. Over time, T-cell and B-cell infiltration becomes more diffuse and axonal injury more widespread, leading to self-perpetuating atrophy in both white and gray matter. With disease progression, inflammatory processes are predominantly driven by the action of CNS resident microglia cells. In addition, there is evidence that meningeal lymphoid-like structures can form and contribute to late-stage inflammation. In general, however, despite dynamic changes over time in MS pathology, lesions do not appear to differ significantly in the different classic forms of MS already identified. While all treatments approved for MS management target inflammatory components of RRMS, the B-cell-depleting antibody ocrelizumab is the first such treatment approved recently for primary progressive (PP) MS. However, recent pathological and imaging findings have prompted reconsideration of the clinical phenotypes of MS patients proposed by Lublin's 2013 classification, including clinical and MRI signs of activity, and new imaging biomarkers of remyelination are now being investigated for new strategies of MS management.\", 'An atlas of neuroplastic potential in brain-damaged patients. ', 'Drosophila Clock Is Required in Brain Pacemaker Neurons to Prevent Premature Locomotor Aging Independently of Its Circadian Function. Circadian clocks control many self-sustained rhythms in physiology and behavior with approximately 24-hour periodicity. In many organisms, oxidative stress and aging negatively impact the circadian system and sleep. Conversely, loss of the clock decreases resistance to oxidative stress, and may reduce lifespan and speed up brain aging and neurodegeneration. Here we examined the effects of clock disruptions on locomotor aging and longevity in Drosophila. We found that lifespan was similarly reduced in three arrhythmic mutants (ClkAR, cyc0and tim0) and in wild-type flies under constant light, which stops the clock. In contrast, ClkARmutants showed significantly faster age-related locomotor deficits (as monitored by startle-induced climbing) than cyc0and tim0, or than control flies under constant light. Reactive oxygen species accumulated more with age in ClkARmutant brains, but this did not appear to contribute to the accelerated locomotor decline of the mutant. Clk, but not Cyc, inactivation by RNA interference in the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-expressing central pacemaker neurons led to similar loss of climbing performance as ClkAR. Conversely, restoring Clk function in these cells was sufficient to rescue the ClkARlocomotor phenotype, independently of behavioral rhythmicity. Accelerated locomotor decline of the ClkARmutant required expression of the PDF receptor and correlated to an apparent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the posterior protocerebral lateral 1 (PPL1) clusters. This neuronal loss was rescued when the ClkARmutation was placed in an apoptosis-deficient background. Impairing dopamine synthesis in a single pair of PPL1 neurons that innervate the mushroom bodies accelerated locomotor decline in otherwise wild-type flies. Our results therefore reveal a novel circadian-independent requirement for Clk in brain circadian neurons to maintain a subset of dopaminergic cells and avoid premature locomotor aging in Drosophila.', 'Altered behaviour, dopamine and norepinephrine regulation in stressed mice heterozygous in TPH2 gene. Gene-environment interaction (GxE) determines the vulnerability of an individual to a spectrum of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased impulsivity, excessive aggression, and other behavioural characteristics are associated with variants within the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) gene, a key enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. This phenotype is recapitulated in naïve mice with complete, but not with partial Tph2 inactivation. Tph2 haploinsufficiency in animals reflects allelic variation of Tph2 facilitating the elucidation of respective GxE mechanisms. Recently, we showed excessive aggression and altered serotonin brain metabolism in heterozygous Tph2-deficient male mice (Tph2+/−) after predator stress exposure. Here, we sought to extend these studies by investigating aggressive and anxiety-like behaviours, sociability, and the brain metabolism of dopamine and noradrenaline. Separately, Tph2+/− mice were examined for exploration activity in a novel environment and for the potentiation of helplessness in the modified swim test (ModFST). Predation stress procedure increased measures of aggression, dominancy, and suppressed sociability in Tph2+/− mice, which was the opposite of that observed in control mice. Anxiety-like behaviour was unaltered in the mutants and elevated in controls. Tph2+/− mice exposed to environmental novelty or to the ModFST exhibited increased novelty exploration and no increase in floating behaviour compared to controls, which is suggestive of resilience to stress and despair. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed significant genotype-dependent differences in the metabolism of dopamine, and norepinephrine within the brain tissue. In conclusion, environmentally challenged Tph2+/− mice exhibit behaviours that resemble the behaviour of non-stressed null mutants, which reveals how GxE interaction studies can unmask latent genetically determined predispositions.', 'The hspg syndecan is a core organizer of cholinergic synapses. The extracellular matrix has emerged as an active component of chemical synapses regulating synaptic formation, maintenance, and homeostasis. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) syndecans are known to regulate cellular and axonal migration in the brain. They are also enriched at synapses, but their synaptic functions remain more elusive. Here, we show that SDN-1, the sole orthologue of syndecan in C. elegans, is absolutely required for the synaptic clustering of homomeric α7-like acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and regulates the synaptic content of heteromeric AChRs. SDN-1 is concentrated at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) by the neurally secreted synaptic organizer Ce-Punctin/MADD-4, which also activates the transmembrane netrin receptor DCC. Those cooperatively recruit the FARP and CASK orthologues that localize α7-like-AChRs at cholinergic NMJs through physical interactions. Therefore, SDN-1 stands at the core of the cholinergic synapse organization by bridging the extracellular synaptic determinants to the intracellular synaptic scaffold that controls the postsynaptic receptor content.', 'Empirical Bayes evaluation of fused EEG-MEG source reconstruction: Application to auditory mismatch evoked responses. We here turn the general and theoretical question of the complementarity of EEG and MEG for source reconstruction, into a practical empirical one. Precisely, we address the challenge of evaluating multimodal data fusion on real data. For this purpose, we build on the flexibility of Parametric Empirical Bayes, namely for EEG-MEG data fusion, group level inference and formal hypothesis testing. The proposed approach follows a two-step procedure by first using unimodal or multimodal inference to derive a cortical solution at the group level; and second by using this solution as a prior model for single subject level inference based on either unimodal or multimodal data. Interestingly, for inference based on the same data (EEG, MEG or both), one can then formally compare, as alternative hypotheses, the relative plausibility of the two unimodal and the multimodal group priors. Using auditory data, we show that this approach enables to draw important conclusions, namely on (i) the superiority of multimodal inference, (ii) the greater spatial sensitivity of MEG compared to EEG, (iii) the ability of EEG data alone to source reconstruct temporal lobe activity, (iv) the usefulness of EEG to improve MEG based source reconstruction. Importantly, we largely reproduce those findings over two different experimental conditions. We here focused on Mismatch Negativity (MMN) responses for which generators have been extensively investigated with little homogeneity in the reported results. Our multimodal inference at the group level revealed spatio-temporal activity within the supratemporal plane with a precision which, to our knowledge, has never been achieved before with non-invasive recordings.', 'Brain connections derived from diffusion MRI tractography can be highly anatomically accurate—if we know where white matter pathways start, where they end, and where they do not go. MR Tractography, which is based on MRI measures of water diffusivity, is currently the only method available for noninvasive reconstruction of fiber pathways in the brain. However, it has several fundamental limitations that call into question its accuracy in many applications. Therefore, there has been intense interest in defining and mitigating the intrinsic limitations of the method. Recent studies have reported that tractography is inherently limited in its ability to accurately reconstruct the connections of the brain, when based on voxel-averaged estimates of local fiber orientation alone. Several validation studies have confirmed that tractography techniques are plagued by both false-positive and false-negative connections. However, these validation studies which quantify sensitivity and specificity, particularly in animal models, have not utilized prior anatomical knowledge, as is done in the human literature, for virtual dissection of white matter pathways, instead assessing tractography implemented in a relatively unconstrained manner. Thus, they represent a worse-case scenario for bundle-segmentation techniques and may not be indicative of the anatomical accuracy in the process of bundle segmentation, where streamline filtering using inclusion and exclusion regions-of-interest is common. With this in mind, the aim of the current study is to investigate and quantify the upper bounds of accuracy using current tractography methods. Making use of the same dataset utilized in two seminal validation papers, we show that prior anatomical knowledge in the form of manually placed or template-driven constraints can significantly improve the anatomical accuracy of estimated brain connections. Thus, we show that it is possible to achieve a high sensitivity and high specificity simultaneously, and conclude that current tractography algorithms, in combination with anatomically driven constraints, can result in reconstructions which very accurately reflect the ground truth white matter connections.', 'Evolution of the mind and the brain. ', 'A set of regulatory genes co-expressed in embryonic human brain is implicated in disrupted speech development. Genetic investigations of people with impaired development of spoken language provide windows into key aspects of human biology. Over 15 years after FOXP2 was identified, most speech and language impairments remain unexplained at the molecular level. We sequenced whole genomes of nineteen unrelated individuals diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech, a rare disorder enriched for causative mutations of large effect. Where DNA was available from unaffected parents, we discovered de novo mutations, implicating genes, including CHD3, SETD1A and WDR5. In other probands, we identified novel loss-of-function variants affecting KAT6A, SETBP1, ZFHX4, TNRC6B and MKL2, regulatory genes with links to neurodevelopment. Several of the new candidates interact with each other or with known speech-related genes. Moreover, they show significant clustering within a single co-expression module of genes highly expressed during early human brain development. This study highlights gene regulatory pathways in the developing brain that may contribute to acquisition of proficient speech.', \"The gut in Parkinson’s disease: Bottom-up, top-down, or neither?. The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to decipher its role in the disease pathogenesis, several animal models have been developed. Most of these models tried to reproduce Braak's hypothesis by showing that the pathological process could spread from the gut to the brain (bottom-up scenario). Interestingly, others groups showed that a top-down scenario could also occur and that 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal denervation was sufficient to induce significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aside from this toxic approach, the article by O’Donovan and colleagues in this edition of Neurogastroenterology and Motility showed that bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-alpha-synuclein in rats was accompanied by changes in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiota, which occurred without any apparent brain-to-gut spread of human injected alpha-synuclein. Some changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract of animals injected with AAV-alpha-synuclein were in line with previous observations in Parkinson's disease patients, including increased expression of glial markers, swollen tyrosine hydroxylase-positive varicosities in the submucosal plexus, and decreases in Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. These findings suggest that, in addition to gut-brain pathways, the brain-to-gut communication may also be involved in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. In this mini-review, we describe the strengths and limitations of the existing studies on the gut-brain axis in experimental models of parkinsonism and discuss an alternative hypothesis in which the central and enteric nervous system would evolve separately during disease progression.\", 'Correlates of social exclusion in social anxiety disorder: An fMRI study. Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is maintained by biased information processing vis-à-vis threat of social exclusion. However, uncertainty still abounds regarding the very nature of this sensitivity to social exclusion in SAD. Especially, brain alterations related to social exclusion have not been explored in SAD. Our primary purpose was thus to determine both the selfreport and neural correlates of social exclusion in this population. 23 patients with SAD and 23 matched nonanxious controls played a virtual game (\"Cyberball\") during fMRI recording. Participants were first included by other players, then excluded, and finally re-included. At the behavioral level, patients with SAD exhibited significantly higher levels of social exclusion feelings than nonanxious controls. At the brain level, patients with SAD exhibited significantly higher activation within the left inferior frontal gyrus relative to nonanxious controls during the re-inclusion phase. Moreover, self-report of social exclusion correlates with the activity of this cluster among individuals qualifying for SAD diagnosis. Our pattern of findings lends strong support to the notion that SAD may be better portrayed by a poor ability to recover following social exclusion than during social exclusion per se. These findings value social neuroscience as an innovative procedure to gain new insight into the underlying mechanisms of SAD.', \"A totally data-driven whole-brain multimodal pipeline for the discrimination of Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and healthy control. Parkinson's Disease (PD)and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)are two parkinsonian syndromes that share many symptoms, albeit having very different prognosis. Although previous studies have proposed multimodal MRI protocols combined with multivariate analysis to discriminate between these two populations and healthy controls, studies combining all MRI indexes relevant for these disorders (i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, iron deposition, brain activity at rest and brain connectivity)with a completely data-driven voxelwise analysis for discrimination are still lacking. In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC)group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94)and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.\", 'Gliovascular changes precede white matter damage and long-term disorders in juvenile mild closed head injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of hospital visits in pediatric patients and often leads to long-term disorders even in cases of mild severity. White matter (WM) alterations are commonly observed in patients months or years after the injury assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but little is known about WM pathophysiology early after mild pediatric TBI. To evaluate the status of the gliovascular unit in this context, mild TBI was induced in postnatal-day 17 mice using a closed head injury model with two grades of severity (G1, G2). G2 resulted in significant WM edema (increased T2-signal) and BBB damage (IgG-extravasation immunostaining) whereas decreased T2 and the increased levels of astrocytic water-channel AQP4 were observed in G1 mice 1 day post-injury. Both severities induced astrogliosis (GFAP immunolabeling). No changes in myelin and neurofilament were detected at this acute time point. One month after injury G2 mice exhibited diffusion tensor imaging MRI alterations (decreased fractional anisotropy) accompanied by decreased neurofilament staining in the WM. Both severities induced behavioral impairments at this time point. In conclusion, long-term deficits and WM changes similar to those found after clinical TBI are preceded by distinct early gliovascular phenotype alterations after juvenile mild TBI, revealing AQP4 as a potential candidate for severity-based treatments.', \"Definition and diagnostic criteria of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. The syndrome known as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is recognized worldwide and has been studied in a wide range of clinical and scientific settings (epilepsy, sleep medicine, neurosurgery, pediatric neurology, epidemiology, genetics). Though uncommon, it is of considerable interest to practicing neurologists because of complexity in differential diagnosis from more common, benign sleep disorders such as parasomnias, or other disorders like psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.Moreover, misdiagnosis can have substantial adverse consequences on patients' lives. At present, there is no consensus definition of this disorder and disagreement persists about its core electroclinical features and the spectrum of etiologies involved. To improve the definition of the disorder and establish diagnostic criteria with levels of certainty, a consensus conference using formal recommended methodology was held in Bologna in September 2014. It was recommended that the name be changed to sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), reflecting evidence that the attacks are associated with sleep rather than time of day, the seizures may arise from extrafrontal sites, and the motor aspects of the seizures are characteristic. The etiology may be genetic or due to structural pathology, but in most cases remains unknown. Diagnostic criteria were developed with 3 levels of certainty: witnessed (possible) SHE, video-documented (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-documented (confirmed) SHE. Themain research gaps involve epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis.\", 'A Fluorescent Polymer Probe with High Selectivity toward Vascular Endothelial Cells for and beyond Noninvasive Two-Photon Intravital Imaging of Brain Vasculature. A chromophore-engineering strategy that relies on the introduction of a ground-state distortion in a quadrupolar chromophore was used to obtain a quasi-quadrupolar chromophore with red emission and large two-photon absorption (2PA) cross-section in polar solvents. This molecule was functionalized with water-solubilizing polymer chains. It constitutes not only a remarkable contrast agent for intravital two-photon microscopy of the functional cerebral vasculature in a minimally invasive configuration but presents intriguing endothelial staining ability that makes it a valuable probe for premortem histological staining.', 'Microlissencephaly due to pathogenic variants of NDE1: From pathology to normal brain development. Pathogenic variants of the gene NDE1 (Nuclear Distribution Element 1) in humans lead to microlissencephaly which associates a reduced head circumference and a simplified gyration. Microlissencephaly is the most severe deficit of neurogenesis described to date but its precise physiopathological mechanism is not yet well known. The NDE1 gene encodes a phosphoprotein that is essential to neurogenesis and that is expressed in various cell compartments of neuroblasts. More than 60 interaction partners with NDE1 have been reported, notably various proteins involved in formation of the mitotic spindle, in ciliation, in genome protection of dividing neuroblasts or even in apoptosis (like LISI, dynein or cohesin), which are all avenues that we explore in this review.', 'Resting-state brain network topological properties and the correlation with neuropsychological assessment in adolescent narcolepsy. Study Objectives: To evaluate functional connectivity and topological properties of brain networks, and to investigate the association between brain topological properties and neuropsychiatric behaviors in adolescent narcolepsy. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological assessment were applied in 26 adolescent narcolepsy patients and 30 healthy controls. fMRI data were analyzed in three ways: group independent component analysis and a graph theoretical method were applied to evaluate topological properties within the whole brain. Lastly, network-based statistics was utilized for group comparisons in region-to-region connectivity. The relationship between topological properties and neuropsychiatric behaviors was analyzed with correlation analyses. Results: In addition to sleepiness, depressive symptoms and impulsivity were detected in adolescent narcolepsy. In adolescent narcolepsy, functional connectivity was decreased between regions of the limbic system and the default mode network (DMN), and increased in the visual network. Adolescent narcolepsy patients exhibited disrupted small-world network properties. Regional alterations in the caudate nucleus (CAU) and posterior cingulate gyrus were associated with subjective sleepiness and regional alterations in the CAU and inferior occipital gyrus were associated with impulsiveness. Remodeling within the salience network and the DMN was associated with sleepiness, depressive feelings, and impulsive behaviors in narcolepsy. Conclusions: Alterations in brain connectivity and regional topological properties in narcoleptic adolescents were associated with their sleepiness, depressive feelings, and impulsive behaviors.', 'Looking outside the box: Better understanding of the extra-cerebral consequences of brain aggression. ', 'Differential functional connectivity underlying asymmetric reward-related activity in human and nonhuman primates. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a key brain region involved in complex cognitive functions such as reward processing and decision making. Neuroimaging studies have reported unilateral OFC response to reward-related variables; however, those studies rarely discussed this observation. Nevertheless, some lesion studies suggest that the left and right OFC contribute differently to cognitive processes. We hypothesized that the OFC asymmetrical response to reward could reflect underlying hemispherical difference in OFC functional connectivity. Using resting-state and reward-related functional MRI data from humans and from rhesus macaques, we first identified an asymmetrical response of the lateral OFC to reward in both species. Crucially, the subregion showing the highest reward-related asymmetry (RRA) overlapped with the region showing the highest functional connectivity asymmetry (FCA). Furthermore, the two types of asymmetries were found to be significantly correlated across individuals. In both species, the right lateral OFC was more connected to the default mode network compared to the left lateral OFC. Altogether, our results suggest a functional specialization of the left and right lateral OFC in primates.', 'A CBF decrease in the left supplementary motor areas: New insight into postoperative pediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome using arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI. Postoperative pediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome (pCMS), characterized mainly by delayed onset transient mutism is a poorly understood complication that may occur after pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) resection. Our aim was to investigate postoperative changes in whole-brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest in pCMS patients using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging. This study compared preoperative and postoperative T2-weighted signal abnormalities and CBF using a voxel-wise, whole-brain analysis in 27 children undergoing MB resection, including 11 patients who developed mutism and 16 who did not. Comparison of postoperative T2 signal abnormalities between patients who developed pCMS (mean age 7.0 years) and those who did not showed that pCMS (mean age 8.9 years) patients were significantly more likely to present with T2-weighted hyperintensities in the right dentate nucleus (DN) (p = 0.02). Comparison of preoperative and postoperative CBF in patients with pCMS showed a significant postoperative CBF decrease in the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) (p = 0.007) and SMA (p = 0.009). In patients who did not develop pCMS, no significant differences were observed. Findings provide evidence of an association between pCMS, injury to the right DN, and left pre-SMA/SMA hypoperfusion, areas responsible for speech. This supports the relevance of CBF investigations in pCMS.', 'Self-health monitoring and wearable neurotechnologies. Brain-computer interfaces and wearable neurotechnologies are now used to measure real-time neural and physiologic signals from the human body and hold immense potential for advancements in medical diagnostics, prevention, and intervention. Given the future role that wearable neurotechnologies will likely serve in the health sector, a critical state-of-the-art assessment is necessary to gain a better understanding of their current strengths and limitations. In this chapter we present wearable electroencephalography systems that reflect groundbreaking innovations and improvements in real-time data collection and health monitoring. We focus on specifications reflecting technical advantages and disadvantages, discuss their use in fundamental and clinical research, their current applications, limitations, and future directions. While many methodological and ethical challenges remain, these systems host the potential to facilitate large-scale data collection far beyond the reach of traditional research laboratory settings.', 'Gut-brain signaling in energy homeostasis: The unexpected role of microbiota-derived succinate. In the context of the obesity epidemic, dietary fibers that are found essentially in fruit and vegetables attract more and more attention, since they exert numerous metabolic benefits resulting in the moderation of body weight. Short-chain fatty acids, such as propionate and butyrate, produced through their fermentation by the intestinal microbiota, have long been thought to be the mediators of these benefits. In fact, propionate and butyrate were recently shown to activate intestinal gluconeogenesis, a function exerting metabolic benefits via its capacity of signaling to the brain by gastrointestinal nerves. Recently, succinate, the precursor of propionate in the bacterial metabolism, has also been shown to exert signaling properties, including the activation of intestinal gluconeogenesis.', \"Diffusion tensor imaging marks dopaminergic and serotonergic lesions in the Parkinsonian monkey. Background: Diffusion tensor imaging has received major interest to highlight markers of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Whether the alteration of diffusion parameters mostly depicts dopaminergic lesions or can also reveal serotonergic denervation remains a question. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the best diffusion tensor imaging markers of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 3,4-methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA; also known as ecstasy) lesions in the nonhuman primate. Methods: We acquired measures of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy longitudinally (before and after MPTP and MDMA) and correlated them with severity of parkinsonism, PET imaging, and postmortem fiber quantification. Results: MPTP-induced lesions were associated with increases of mean diffusivity within both the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas MDMA-induced lesions caused an increase of fractional anisotropy within the caudate nucleus. These variations of diffusion tensor imaging correlated with the motor score. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate that diffusion measures within specific brain regions can mark severity of dopaminergic and serotonergic induced lesions in a neurotoxic nonhuman primate model of Parkinson's disease. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\", 'Mutations in the X-linked ATP6AP2 cause a glycosylation disorder with autophagic defects. The biogenesis of the multi-subunit vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum with the assembly of the proton pore V0, which is controlled by a group of assembly factors. Here, we identify two hemizygous missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the accessory V-ATPase subunit ATP6AP2 (also known as the [pro]renin receptor) responsible for a glycosylation disorder with liver disease, immunodeficiency, cutis laxa, and psychomotor impairment. We show that ATP6AP2 deficiency in the mouse liver caused hypoglycosylation of serum proteins and autophagy defects. The introduction of one of the missense mutations into Drosophila led to reduced survival and altered lipid metabolism. We further demonstrate that in the liver-like fat body, the autophagic dysregulation was associated with defects in lysosomal acidification and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, both ATP6AP2 mutations impaired protein stability and the interaction with ATP6AP1, a member of the V0 assembly complex. Collectively, our data suggest that the missense mutations in ATP6AP2 lead to impaired V-ATPase assembly and subsequent defects in glycosylation and autophagy.', 'Neurobiological Divergence of the Positive and Negative Schizophrenia Subtypes Identified on a New Factor Structure of Psychopathology Using Non-negative Factorization: An International Machine Learning Study. Background: Disentangling psychopathological heterogeneity in schizophrenia is challenging, and previous results remain inconclusive. We employed advanced machine learning to identify a stable and generalizable factorization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and used it to identify psychopathological subtypes as well as their neurobiological differentiations. Methods: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale data from the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring and Outcome Survey cohort (1545 patients; 586 followed up after 1.35 ± 0.70 years) were used for learning the factor structure by an orthonormal projective non-negative factorization. An international sample, pooled from 9 medical centers across Europe, the United States, and Asia (490 patients), was used for validation. Patients were clustered into psychopathological subtypes based on the identified factor structure, and the neurobiological divergence between the subtypes was assessed by classification analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity patterns. Results: A 4-factor structure representing negative, positive, affective, and cognitive symptoms was identified as the most stable and generalizable representation of psychopathology. It showed higher internal consistency than the original Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales and previously proposed factor models. Based on this representation, the positive–negative dichotomy was confirmed as the (only) robust psychopathological subtypes, and these subtypes were longitudinally stable in about 80% of the repeatedly assessed patients. Finally, the individual subtype could be predicted with good accuracy from functional connectivity profiles of the ventromedial frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. Conclusions: Machine learning applied to multisite data with cross-validation yielded a factorization generalizable across populations and medical systems. Together with subtyping and the demonstrated ability to predict subtype membership from neuroimaging data, this work further disentangles the heterogeneity in schizophrenia.', \"Brain insulin response and peripheral metabolic changes in a Tau transgenic mouse model. Accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated and aggregated Tau proteins is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Tauopathies. AD patient brains also exhibit insulin resistance. Whereas, under normal physiological conditions insulin signaling in the brain mediates plasticity and memory formation, it can also regulate peripheral energy homeostasis. Thus, in AD, brain insulin resistance affects both cognitive and metabolic changes described in these patients. While a role of Aβ oligomers and APOE4 towards the development of brain insulin resistance emerged, contribution of Tau pathology has been largely overlooked. Our recent data demonstrated that one of the physiological function of Tau is to sustain brain insulin signaling. We postulated that under pathological conditions, hyper-phosphorylated/aggregated Tau is likely to lose this function and to favor the development of brain insulin resistance. This hypothesis was substantiated by observations from patient brains with pure Tauopathies. To address the potential link between Tau pathology and brain insulin resistance, we have evaluated the brain response to insulin in a transgenic mouse model of AD-like Tau pathology (THY-Tau22). Using electrophysiological and biochemical evaluations, we surprisingly observed that, at a time when Tau pathology and cognitive deficits are overt and obvious, the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 mice exhibits enhanced response to insulin. In addition, we demonstrated that the ability of i.c.v. insulin to promote body weight loss is enhanced in THY-Tau22 mice. In line with this, THY-Tau22 mice exhibited a lower body weight gain, hypoleptinemia and hypoinsulinemia and finally a metabolic resistance to high-fat diet. The present data highlight that the brain of transgenic Tau mice exhibit enhanced brain response to insulin. Whether these observations are ascribed to the development of Tau pathology, and therefore relevant to human Tauopathies, or unexpectedly results from the Tau transgene overexpression is debatable and discussed.\", 'Preclinical Alzheimer\\'s disease: Definition, natural history, and diagnostic criteria. During the past decade, a conceptual shift occurred in the field of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) considering the disease as a continuum. Thanks to evolving biomarker research and substantial discoveries, it is now possible to identify the disease even at the preclinical stage before the occurrence of the first clinical symptoms. This preclinical stage of AD has become a major research focus as the field postulates that early intervention may offer the best chance of therapeutic success. To date, very little evidence is established on this \"silent\" stage of the disease. A clarification is needed about the definitions and lexicon, the limits, the natural history, the markers of progression, and the ethical consequence of detecting the disease at this asymptomatic stage. This article is aimed at addressing all the different issues by providing for each of them an updated review of the literature and evidence, with practical recommendations.', 'Relation between 20-year income volatility and brain health in midlife: The CARDIA study. Objective Income volatility presents a growing public health threat. To our knowledge, no previous study examined the relationship among income volatility, cognitive function, and brain integrity. Methods We studied 3,287 participants aged 23-35 years in 1990 from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults prospective cohort study. Income volatility data were created using income data collected from 1990 to 2010 and defined as SD of percent change in income and number of income drops ≥25% (categorized as 0, 1, or 2+). In 2010, cognitive tests (n = 3,287) and brain scans (n = 716) were obtained. Results After covariate adjustment, higher income volatility was associated with worse performance on processing speed (β = −1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.73 to −0.44) and executive functioning (β = 2.53, 95% CI 0.60-4.50) but not on verbal memory (β = −0.02, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.11). Similarly, additional income drops were associated with worse performance on processing speed and executive functioning. Higher income volatility and more income drops were also associated with worse microstructural integrity of total brain and total white matter. All findings were similar when restricted to those with high education, suggesting reverse causation may not explain these findings. Conclusion Income volatility over a 20-year period of formative earning years was associated with worse cognitive function and brain integrity in midlife.', 'The PET radioligand <sup>18</sup>F-FIMX images and quantifies metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in proportion to the regional density of its gene transcript in human brain. A recent study from our laboratory found that 18F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of 18F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region. Methods: After injection of 189 ± 3 MBq of 18F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolitecorrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure. Results: 18F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV 5 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mL?cm?3) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of 18F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mL?cm?3). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binDing. Similar to other 18F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 ?Sv/MBq. Conclusion: 18FFIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120-to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binDing of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.', \"Topological disintegration of resting state functional connectomes in coma. Graph theory has been playing an increasingly important role in understanding the organizational properties of brain networks, subsequently providing new tools for the search of neural correlates of consciousness, particularly in the context of patients recovering from severe brain injury. However, this approach is not without challenges, as it usually relies on arbitrarily fixing a threshold in order to retain the strongest connections proportionally equal across subjects. This method increases the comparability between individuals or groups but it risks the inclusion of false positive and therefore spurious connections, especially in the context of brain disorders. Resting state data acquired in 25 coma patients and 22 healthy subjects was compared. We obtained a representative fixed density of significant connections by first applying a p-value-based threshold on healthy subjects' networks and then choosing a threshold at which all individuals exhibited meaningful connections. The obtained threshold (i.e. 10%) was used to construct graphs in the patient group. The findings showed that coma patients have lower number of significant connections with approximately 50% of them not fulfilling the criteria of the fixed density threshold. The remaining patients with relatively preserved global functional connectivity had sufficient significant connections between regions, but showed signs of major whole-brain network reorganization. These results warrant careful consideration in the construction of functional connectomes in patients with disorders of consciousness and set the scene for future studies investigating potential clinical implications of such an approach.\", 'Stress decreases pollen foraging performance in honeybees. Foraging in honeybees is energetically demanding. Here, we examined whether stressors, which generally increase metabolic demands, can impair foraging performance. A controlled non-pathogenic stressor (immune challenge) resulted in a change in the foraging preferences of bees. It reduced pollen foraging and increased the duration of trips in pollen foragers. Stress also reduced the amount of octopamine in the brain of pollen foragers (a biogenic amine involved in the regulation of foraging and flight behaviour in insects). According to the literature, flight metabolic rate is higher during pollen foraging than during nectar foraging, and nectar gives a higher energetic return relative to the foraging effort when compared with pollen. We thus propose that stress might be particularly detrimental to the performance of pollen foragers, and stressed bees prefer the energy-rich resource of nectar. In conclusion, stress, even at low levels, could have consequences for bee foraging behaviour and thereby the nutritional balance of the colony.', 'Predictive position computations mediated by parietal areas: TMS evidence. When objects move or the eyes move, the visual system can predict the consequence and generate a percept of the target at its new position. This predictive localization may depend on eye movement control in the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and on motion analysis in the medial temporal area (MT). Across two experiments we examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right FEF, right IPS, right MT, and a control site, peripheral V1/V2, diminished participants’ perception of two cases of predictive position perception: trans-saccadic fusion, and the flash grab illusion, both presented in the contralateral visual field. In trans-saccadic fusion trials, participants saccade toward a stimulus that is replaced with another stimulus during the saccade. Frequently, predictive position mechanisms lead to a fused percept of pre- and post-saccade stimuli (Paeye et al., 2017). We found that rTMS to IPS significantly decreased the frequency of perceiving trans-saccadic fusion within the first 10\\xa0min after stimulation. In the flash grab illusion, a target is flashed on a moving background leading to the percept that the target has shifted in the direction of the motion after the flash (Cavanagh and Anstis, 2013). In the first experiment, the reduction in the flash grab illusion after rTMS to IPS and FEF did not reach significance. In the second experiment, using a stronger version of the flash grab, the illusory shift did decrease significantly after rTMS to IPS although not after rTMS to FEF or to MT. These findings suggest that right IPS contributes to predictive position perception during saccades and motion processing in the contralateral visual field.', 'Cerebral imaging of post-stroke plasticity and tissue repair. Six months after stroke onset, 50 % of patients are still disabled and dependent, while many brain mechanisms of recovery remain partially unknown or misunderstood. However, brain imaging and cerebral connectivity analytical techniques have provided invaluable insights into such mechanisms and identified two main patterns of brain reorganization depending on stroke severity. The contralesional primary motor cortex can take over motor function in severely impaired patients, whereas the ipsilesional motor cortex or hemisphere reorganize themselves in good recoverers. These patterns evolve with time after stroke, and highlight ipsilesional and contralesional primary and secondary areas that appear to take over lost functions. The crucial role of these areas has been confirmed by histological tracer studies. In addition, non-invasive techniques can stimulate post-stroke brain plasticity, although appropriate targets first need to be found. Imaging has proved useful for finding such appropriate targets and has also provided biomarkers of efficacy with various therapies. Moreover, it has provided some clues to the mechanisms of action of recovery-enhancing drugs. These imaging techniques have also identified patients who show atypical reorganization and recovery patterns. Thus, it may be necessary to design individualized and targeted therapies.', 'Factor VIII: Long-established role in haemophilia A and emerging evidence beyond haemostasis. Factor VIII protein (FVIII) as a coagulation replacement factor has for decades been used as the standard of care for management of people with haemophilia A. It is effective for treatment of bleeding events, as prophylaxis to prevent bleeding events and preserve joint function, and to support surgery in people with haemophilia A. Despite long experience in treating haemophilia A, we are only beginning to understand the functions of FVIII beyond its established role as a coenzyme to factor IXa to expedite thrombin generation through the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Here, we review the current role of FVIII coagulant (FVIII:C) in haemophilia A management and emerging evidence for the role of FVIII across multiple systems, including the cardiovascular system, angiogenesis and maintenance of bone health. For instance, supraphysiological FVIII levels are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. von Willebrand factor (VWF), which forms a non-covalent complex with circulating FVIII, is an established marker and regulator of angiogenesis. In a mouse model of haemophilia, treatment with FVIII decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), a marker for bone turnover. Longitudinal follow-up data in people with haemophilia A are needed to confirm and extend these observations.', 'One size fits all does not apply to brain lateralisation: Comment on “Phenotypes in hemispheric functional segregation? Perspectives and challenges” by Guy Vingerhoets. ', \"Raman Imaging Reveals Accumulation of Hemoproteins in Plaques from Alzheimer's Diseased Tissues. Hemes have been suggested to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease since they show high peroxidase reactivity when bound to amyloid β peptides, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species. Here we used Fourier transform infrared and Raman imaging on Alzheimer's diseased mice and human brain tissue. Our finding suggests the accumulation of hemes in the senile plaques of both murine and human samples. We compared the Raman signature of the plaques to the ones of various hemeoproteins and to the hemin-Aβ-42 complex. The detected Raman signature of the plaques does not allow identifying the type of heme accumulating in the plaques.\", 'Surface trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors: From cultured neurons to intact brain preparations. Over the last decade, developments in single molecule imaging have changed our vision of synaptic physiology. By providing high spatio-temporal resolution maps of the molecular actors of neurotransmissions, these techniques have revealed that pre- and post-synaptic proteins are not randomly distributed but precisely organized at the nanoscale, and that this specific organization is dynamically regulated. At the centre of synaptic transmissions, neurotransmitter receptors have been shown to form nanodomains at synapses and to dynamically move in and out of these confinement areas through lateral diffusion within the membrane plane on millisecond timescales, thereby directly contributing to the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Since the vast majority of these discoveries originated from observations made on dissociated neurons lacking several features of brain tissue (e.g. three-dimensional organization, tissue density), they were initially considered with caution. However, the recent implementation of single-particle tracking (SPT) approaches in cultured and acute brain preparations confirmed that early findings on the dynamic properties of receptors at the surface of neurons can be extended to more physiological conditions. Taking example of dopamine D1 and NMDA glutamate receptors we here review our current knowledge of the features of neurotransmitter receptor surface diffusion in intact brain tissue. Through detailed comparison with cultured neurons, we also discuss how these biophysical properties are influenced by the complexity of the extracellular environment. This article is part of the special issue entitled ‘Mobility and trafficking of neuronal membrane proteins’.', 'Deciphering the Enigma of the Histone H2A.Z-1/H2A.Z-2 Isoforms: Novel Insights and Remaining Questions. The replication independent (RI) histone H2A.Z is one of the more extensively studied variant members of the core histone H2A family, which consists of many replication dependent (RD) members. The protein has been shown to be indispensable for survival, and involved in multiple roles from DNA damage to chromosome segregation, replication, and transcription. However, its functional involvement in gene expression is controversial. Moreover, the variant in several groups of metazoan organisms consists of two main isoforms (H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2) that differ in a few (3-6) amino acids. They comprise the main topic of this review, starting from the events that led to their identification, what is currently known about them, followed by further experimental, structural, and functional insight into their roles. Despite their structural differences, a direct correlation to their functional variability remains enigmatic. As all of this is being elucidated, it appears that a strong functional involvement of isoform variability may be connected to development.', 'Case report of Lewy body disease mimicking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a 44-year-old man. Background: Few patients are reported with dementia with Lewy bodies before fifty years-old, which may partly reflect the difficulty of accurate diagnosis in young population. We report the case of a 44-year-old male with pathologically confirmed sporadic dementia with Lewy bodies, who did not fulfil the revised clinical criteria for this disease. Case presentation: We document this atypical case with clinical and cognitive evaluation, imaging, biochemistry, genetics and pathology investigations. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was first suspected in this patient with no previous medical history, who developed acute and rapid cognitive impairment, L-dopa-non-responsive parkinsonism, and delusion. Positive 14-3-3 protein was initially detected in cerebrospinal fluid and until the late stages of the disease. Severe atrophy with no diffusion hypersignal was found on structural MRI as well as an extensive hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET, in comparison to age-matched healthy volunteers. Genetic investigation found no alpha-synuclein gene mutation. The patient died within 5 years, and post-mortem examination found numerous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites consistent with pure Lewy body disease. Conclusions: This comprehensively described case illustrates that dementia with Lewy bodies can occur in young patients with atypical clinical presentation. Biochemistry and neuroimaging investigations can sometimes be insufficient to allow accurate diagnostic. More specific markers to support such diagnosis are needed.', 'Known and unknown potentially modifiable factors contributing to outcome in brain-injured patients who need mechanical ventilatory support. Discussion on ‘The BI-VILI project: a nationwide quality improvement project’. ', 'Young Sprague Dawley rats infected by Plasmodium berghei: A relevant experimental model to study cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe manifestation of human malaria yet is still poorly understood. Mouse models have been developed to address the subject. However, their relevance to mimic human pathogenesis is largely debated. Here we study an alternative cerebral malaria model with an experimental Plasmodium berghei Keyberg 173 (K173) infection in Sprague Dawley rats. As in Human, not all infected subjects showed cerebral malaria, with 45% of the rats exhibiting Experimental Cerebral Malaria (ECM) symptoms while the majority (55%) of the remaining rats developed severe anemia and hyperparasitemia (NoECM). These results allow, within the same population, a comparison of the noxious effects of the infection between ECM and severe malaria without ECM. Among the ECM rats, 77.8% died between day 5 and day 12 post-infection, while the remaining rats were spontaneously cured of neurological signs within 24–48 hours. The clinical ECM signs observed were paresis quickly evolving to limb paralysis, global paralysis associated with respiratory distress, and coma. The red blood cell (RBC) count remained normal but a drastic decrease of platelet count and an increase of white blood cell numbers were noted. ECM rats also showed a decrease of glucose and total CO2 levels and an increase of creatinine levels compared to control rats or rats with no ECM. Assessment of the blood-brain barrier revealed loss of integrity, and interestingly histopathological analysis highlighted cyto-adherence and sequestration of infected RBCs in brain vessels from ECM rats only. Overall, this ECM rat model showed numerous clinical and histopathological features similar to Human CM and appears to be a promising model to achieve further understanding the CM pathophysiology in Humans and to evaluate the activity of specific antimalarial drugs in avoiding/limiting cerebral damages from malaria.', 'Locoregional confinement and major clinical benefit of <sup>188</sup>re-loaded CXCR4-targeted nanocarriers in an orthotopic human to mouse model of glioblastoma. Purpose: Gold standard beam radiation for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is challenged by resistance phenomena occurring in cellular populations well prepared to survive or to repair damage caused by radiation. Among signals that have been linked with radio-resistance, the SDF1/CXCR4 axis, associated with cancer stem-like cell, may be an opportune target. To avoid the problem of systemic toxicity and blood-brain barrier crossing, the relevance and efficacy of an original system of local brain internal radiation therapy combining a radiopharmaceutical with an immuno-nanoparticle was investigated. Experiment design: The nanocarrier combined lipophilic thiobenzoate complexes of rhenium-188 loaded in the core of a lipid nanocapsule (LNC188Re) with a function-blocking antibody, 12G5 directed at the CXCR4, on its surface. The efficiency of 12G5-LNC188Re was investigated in an orthotopic and xenogenic GBM model of CXCR4-positive U87MG cells implanted in the striatum of Scid mice. Results: We demonstrated that 12G5-LNC188Re single infusion treatment by convection-enhanced delivery resulted in a major clinical improvement in median survival that was accompanied by locoregional effects on tumor development including hypovascularization and stimulation of the recruitment of bone marrow derived CD11b- or CD68-positive cells as confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis. Interestingly, thorough analysis by spectral imaging in a chimeric U87MG GBM model containing CXCR4-positive/red fluorescent protein (RFP)-positive- and CXCR4-negative/RFP-negative-GBM cells revealed greater confinement of DiD-labeled 12G5-LNCs than control IgG2a-LNCs in RFP compartments. Main conclusion: These findings on locoregional impact and targeting of disseminated cancer cells in tumor margins suggest that intracerebral active targeting of nanocarriers loaded with radiopharmaceuticals may have considerable benefits in clinical applications.', 'Standardized computer-based organized reporting of EEG: SCORE – Second version. Standardized terminology for computer-based assessment and reporting of EEG has been previously developed in Europe. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology established a taskforce in 2013 to develop this further, and to reach international consensus. This work resulted in the second, revised version of SCORE (Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG), which is presented in this paper. The revised terminology was implemented in a software package (SCORE EEG), which was tested in clinical practice on 12,160 EEG recordings. Standardized terms implemented in SCORE are used to report the features of clinical relevance, extracted while assessing the EEGs. Selection of the terms is context sensitive: initial choices determine the subsequently presented sets of additional choices. This process automatically generates a report and feeds these features into a database. In the end, the diagnostic significance is scored, using a standardized list of terms. SCORE has specific modules for scoring seizures (including seizure semiology and ictal EEG patterns), neonatal recordings (including features specific for this age group), and for Critical Care EEG Terminology. SCORE is a useful clinical tool, with potential impact on clinical care, quality assurance, data-sharing, research and education.', 'ICP monitoring and phase-contrast MRI to investigate intracranial compliance. Objective: The amplitude of intracranial pressure (ICP) can be measured by ICP monitoring. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PCMRI) can quantify blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows. The aim of this work was to investigate intracranial compliance at rest by combining baseline ICP monitoring and PCMRI in hydrocephalus patients. Materials and methods: ICP monitoring was performed before infusion testing to quantify ΔICP_rest at the basal condition in 33 suspected hydrocephalus patients (74 years). The day before, patients had had a PCMRI to assess total cerebral blood flow (tCBF), intracranial blood volume change (stroke volume SVblood), and cervical CSF volume change (the stroke volume CSV). Global (blood and CSF) intracranial volume change (ΔIVC) during each cardiac cycle (CC) was calculated. Finally, Compliance: C_rest = ΔIVC/ΔICP_rest was calculated. The data set was postprocessed by two operators according to blind analysis. Results: Bland–Altman plots showed that measurements presented no significant difference between the two operators. ΔICP_rest = 2.41 ± 1.21 mmHg, tCBF = 469.89 ± 127.54 mL/min, SVblood = 0.82 ± 0.32 mL/cc, CSV = 0.50 ± 0.22 mL/cc, ΔIVC = 0.44 ± 0.22 mL, and C_rest = 0.23 ± 0.15 mL/mmHg. There are significant relations between SVblood and CSV and also SVblood and tCBF. Conclusions: During “basal” condition, the compliance amplitude of the intracranial compartment is heterogeneous in suspected hydrocephalus patients, and its value is lower than expected! This new parameter could represent new information, complementary to conventional infusion tests. We hope that this information can be applied to improve the selection of patients for shunt surgery.', 'Sleep during development: Sex and gender differences. Sleep occupies a substantial proportion of life. Sleep modifications parallel brain development during childhood. Sex and gender differences have been reported in brain development and many clinical and psychosocial conditions. This narrative review provides insight into the differences between girls and boys in terms of brain maturation and plasticity related to sleep and sleep characteristics (physiology, sleep duration) during development.', 'New OFSEP recommendations for MRI assessment of multiple sclerosis patients: Special consideration for gadolinium deposition and frequent acquisitions. Purpose: New multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which exert beneficial effects through prevention of relapse, limitation of disability progression, and improvement of patients’ quality of life, have recently emerged. Nonetheless, these DMTs are not without associated complications (severe adverse events like. progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Patient follow-up requires regular clinical evaluations and close monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Detection of new T2 lesions and potential brain atrophy measurements contribute to the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Current MRI protocols for MS recommend the acquisition of an annual gadolinium (Gd) enhanced MRI, resulting in administration of high volume of contrast agents over time and Gd accumulation in the brain. Methods: A consensus report was established by neuroradiologists and neurologists from the French Observatory of MS, which aimed at reducing the number of Gd injections required during MS patient follow-up. Recommendations: The French Observatory of MS recommends the use of macrocyclic Gd enhancement at time of diagnosis, when a new DMT is introduced, at 6-month re-baseline, and when previous scans are unavailable for comparison. Gd administration can be performed as an option in case of relapse or suspicion of intercurrent disease such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other follow-up MRIs do not require contrast enhancement, provided current and previous MRI acquisitions follow the same standardized protocol including 3D FLAIR sequences.', 'Cortical areas involved in behavioral expression of external pallidum dysfunctions: A PET imaging study in non-human primates. The external pallidum (GPe) is a component of the indirect pathway centrally placed in the basal ganglia. Studies already demonstrated that the pharmacological disinhibition of the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic GPe produced dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical regions altered by the disinhibition of each GPe functional territory. Thus, 5 macaques were injected with bicuculline in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic sites of the GPe producing dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, and underwent in vivo positron tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to identify cortical dysfunctions related to GPe disinhibition. Blood cortisol levels were also quantified as a biomarker of anxiety for each condition. Our results showed that pallidal bicuculline injections in anesthetized animals reproducibly modified the activity of specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas depending on the pallidal territory targeted. Bicuculline injections in the limbic GPe led to increased ipsilateral activations in limbic cortical regions (anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). Injections in the associative vs. sensorimotor GPe increased the activity in the ipsilateral midcingulate vs. somatosensory and parietal cortices. Moreover, bicuculline injections increased blood cortisol levels only in animals injected in their limbic GPe. These are the first functional results supporting the model of opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops where modifications in a functional pallidal territory can impact cortical activities of the same functional territory but also cortical activities of other functional territories. This highlights the importance of the GPe as a crucial node in the top-down control of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits from the frontal cortex to influence the perception, attention, and emotional processes at downstream (or non-frontal) cortical levels. Finally, we showed the implication of the ventral pallidum with the amygdala and the insular cortex in a circuit related to aversive processing that should be crucial for the production of anxious disorders.', 'A combination of lipidomics, MS imaging, and PET scan imaging reveals differences in cerebral activity in rat pups according to the lipid quality of infant formulas. We evaluated the effect of adding docosahexaenoic:arachidonic acids (3:2) (DHA+ARA) to 2 representative commercial infant formulas on brain activity and brain and eye lipids in an artificially reared rat pup model. The formula lipid background was either a pure plant oil blend, or dairy fat with a plant oil blend (1:1). Results at weaning were compared to breast milk–fed pups. Brain functional activity was determined by positron emission tomography scan imaging, the brain and eye fatty acid and lipid composition by targeted and untargeted lipidomics, and DHA brain regional location by mass-spectrometry imaging. The brain functional activity was normalized to controls with DHA+ARA added to the formulas. DHA in both brain and eyes was influenced by formula intake, but more than two-thirds of tissue DHA-glycerolipids remained insensitive to the dietary challenge. However, the DHA lipidome correlated better with brain function than sole DHA content (r = 0.70 vs. r = 0.48; P < 0.05). Brain DHA regional distribution was more affected by the formula lipid background than the provision of PUFAs. Adding DHA+ARA to formulas alters the DHA content and lipidome of nervous tissue in the neonate, making it closer to dam milk–fed controls, and normalizes brain functional activity.', 'Heterozygous Variants in KDM4B Lead to Global Developmental Delay and Neuroanatomical Defects. KDM4B is a lysine-specific demethylase with a preferential activity on H3K9 tri/di-methylation (H3K9me3/2)-modified histones. H3K9 tri/di-demethylation is an important epigenetic mechanism responsible for silencing of gene expression in animal development and cancer. However, the role of KDM4B on human development is still poorly characterized. Through international data sharing, we gathered a cohort of nine individuals with mono-allelic de novo or inherited variants in KDM4B. All individuals presented with dysmorphic features and global developmental delay (GDD) with language and motor skills most affected. Three individuals had a history of seizures, and four had anomalies on brain imaging ranging from agenesis of the corpus callosum with hydrocephalus to cystic formations, abnormal hippocampi, and polymicrogyria. In mice, lysine demethylase 4B is expressed during brain development with high levels in the hippocampus, a region important for learning and memory. To understand how KDM4B variants can lead to GDD in humans, we assessed the effect of KDM4B disruption on brain anatomy and behavior through an in vivo heterozygous mouse model (Kdm4b+/−), focusing on neuroanatomical changes. In mutant mice, the total brain volume was significantly reduced with decreased size of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ventriculomegaly. This report demonstrates that variants in KDM4B are associated with GDD/ intellectual disability and neuroanatomical defects. Our findings suggest that KDM4B variation leads to a chromatinopathy, broadening the spectrum of this group of Mendelian disorders caused by alterations in epigenetic machinery.', \"Second World War: Paris neurosurgeon's map outwitted Nazis. \", \"Brain structure and dynamics across scales: In search of rules. Louis Henry Sullivan, the father of skyscrapers, famously stated 'Form ever follows function'. In this short review, we will focus on the relationship between form (structure) and function (dynamics) in the brain. We summarize recent advances on the quantification of directed- and weighted-mesoscopic connectivity of mammalian cortex, the exponential distance rule for mesoscopic and microscopic circuit wiring, a spatially embedded random model of inter-areal cortical networks, and a large-scale dynamical circuit model of money's cortex that gives rise to a hierarchy of timescales. These findings demonstrate that inter-areal cortical networks are dense (hence such concepts as 'small-world' need to be refined when applied to the brain), spatially dependent (therefore purely topological approach of graph theory has limited applicability) and heterogeneous (consequently cortical areas cannot be treated as identical 'nodes').\", \"Genome-wide association study of cerebral small vessel disease reveals established and novel loci. Intracerebral haemorrhage and small vessel ischaemic stroke (SVS) are the most acute manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease, with no established preventive approaches beyond hypertension management. Combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these two correlated diseases may improve statistical power to detect novel genetic factors for cerebral small vessel disease, elucidating underlying disease mechanisms that may form the basis for future treatments. Because intracerebral haemorrhage location is an adequate surrogate for distinct histopathological variants of cerebral small vessel disease (lobar for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and non-lobar for arteriolosclerosis), we performed GWAS of intracerebral haemorrhage by location in 1813 subjects (755 lobar and 1005 non-lobar) and 1711 stroke-free control subjects. Intracerebral haemorrhage GWAS results by location were meta-analysed with GWAS results for SVS from MEGASTROKE, using 'Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS' (MTAG) to integrate summary data across traits and generate combined effect estimates. After combining intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS datasets, our sample size included 241 024 participants (6255 intracerebral haemorrhage or SVS cases and 233 058 control subjects). Genome-wide significant associations were observed for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage enhanced by SVS with rs2758605 [MTAG P-value (P) = 2.6 × 10-8] at 1q22; rs72932727 (P = 1.7 × 10-8) at 2q33; and rs9515201 (P = 5.3 × 10-10) at 13q34. In the GTEx gene expression library, rs2758605 (1q22), rs72932727 (2q33) and rs9515201 (13q34) are significant cis-eQTLs for PMF1 (P = 1 × 10-4 in tibial nerve), NBEAL1, FAM117B and CARF (P 5 2.1 × 10-7 in arteries) and COL4A2 and COL4A1 (P 5 0.01 in brain putamen), respectively. Leveraging S-PrediXcan for gene-based association testing with the predicted expression models in tissues related with nerve, artery, and non-lobar brain, we found that experiment-wide significant (P 5 8.5 × 10-7) associations at three genes at 2q33 including NBEAL1, FAM117B and WDR12 and genomewide significant associations at two genes including ICA1L at 2q33 and ZCCHC14 at 16q24. Brain cell-type specific expression profiling libraries reveal that SEMA4A, SLC25A44 and PMF1 at 1q22 and COL4A1 and COL4A2 at 13q34 were mainly expressed in endothelial cells, while the genes at 2q33 (FAM117B, CARF and NBEAL1) were expressed in various cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our cross-phenotype genetic study of intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS demonstrates novel genome-wide associations for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage at 2q33 and 13q34. Our replication of the 1q22 locus previous seen in traditional GWAS of intracerebral haemorrhage, as well as the rediscovery of 13q34, which had previously been reported in candidate gene studies with other cerebral small vessel disease-related traits strengthens the credibility of applying this novel genome-wide approach across intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS.\", 'Comprehensive mapping of neurotransmitter networks by MALDI–MS imaging. We present a mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) approach for the comprehensive mapping of neurotransmitter networks in specific brain regions. Our fluoromethylpyridinium-based reactive matrices facilitate the covalent charge-tagging of molecules containing phenolic hydroxyl and/or primary or secondary amine groups, including dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters and their associated metabolites. These matrices improved the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)–MSI detection limit toward low-abundance neurotransmitters and facilitated the simultaneous imaging of neurotransmitters in fine structures of the brain at a lateral resolution of 10 µm. We demonstrate strategies for the identification of unknown molecular species using the innate chemoselectivity of the reactive matrices and the unique isotopic pattern of a brominated reactive matrix. We illustrate the capabilities of the developed method on Parkinsonian brain samples from human post-mortem tissue and animal models. The direct imaging of neurotransmitter systems provides a method for exploring how various neurological diseases affect specific brain regions through neurotransmitter modulation.', 'The next generation of approaches to investigate the link between synaptic plasticity and learning. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has since long been proposed to represent the subcellular substrate of learning and memory, one of the most important behavioral processes through which we adapt to our environment. Despite the undisputed importance of synaptic plasticity for brain function, its exact contribution to learning processes in the context of cellular and connectivity modifications remains obscure. Causally bridging synaptic and behavioral modifications indeed remains limited by the available tools to measure and control synaptic strength and plasticity in vivo under behaviorally relevant conditions. After a brief summary of the current state of knowledge of the links between synaptic plasticity and learning, we will review and discuss the available and desired tools to progress in this endeavor.', 'Use of MRI to predict symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis for cerebral ischaemia. Background and objective: Predictors of symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation (s-HT) of cerebral ischaemia after intravenous recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were identified in studies using CT scans. We evaluated whether MRI can identify other predictors. Method: We analysed predictors of s-HT in a cohort of consecutive patients who received intravenous rt-PA for cerebral ischaemia after MRI at baseline. We used receiver operating characteristic curves considering an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 or higher as indicating acceptable discrimination. Results: Of 944 patients, 49 patients (5.2%) developed s-HT. Clinical factors independently associated with s-HT were age (adjusted OR (adjOR) 1.03 for 1 year increase; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05), excessive alcohol consumption (adjOR 3.13; 95% CI 1.32 to 7.42), recent transient ischaemic attack (adjOR 2.88; 95% CI 1.04 to 7.95) and baseline national institutes of health stroke scale score (adjOR 1.06 for 1 point increase; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10). MRI predictors were vascular hyperintensities (adjOR 3.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 10.08), old infarcts (adjOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.66) and volume of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) abnormality (adjOR 1.02 for 1 cm3 increase; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03). The only variable with an acceptable discrimination was volume of DWI abnormality (AUC 0.72; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79), a value of 4 cm3 predicting s-HT with a 78% sensitivity and 58% specificity. Variables that can be assessed only with MRI did not predict s-HT. Conclusion: Although the volume of DWI abnormality predicts s-HT, other imaging characteristics that can only be assessed with MRI were not significantly associated with s-HT.', 'What can we learn from fMRI capture of visual hallucinations in Parkinson’s disease?. With disease progression, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have chronic visual hallucinations (VH). The mechanisms behind this invalidating non-motor symptom remain largely unknown, namely because it is extremely difficult to capture hallucination events. This study aimed to describe the patterns of brain functional changes when VH occur in PD patients. Nine PD patients were enrolled because of their frequent and chronic VH (> 10/day). Patients with severe cognitive decline (MMSE<18) were excluded. Patients were scanned during ON/OFF hallucinatory states and resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed. Data were analyzed in reference to the two-step method, which consists in: (i) a data-driven analysis of per-hallucinatory fMRI data, and (ii) selection of the components of interest based on a post-fMRI interview. The phenomenology of VH ranged from visual spots to distorting faces. First, at the individual level, several VH-related components of interest were identified and integrated in a second-level analysis. Using a random-effects self-organizing-group ICA, we evidenced increased connectivity in visual networks concomitant to VH, encompassing V2, V3 and the fusiform gyri bilaterally. Interestingly, the stability of the default-mode network (DMN) was found positively correlated with VH severity (Spearman’s rho = 0.77, p = 0.05). By using a method that does not need online self-report, we showed that VH in PD patients were associated with functional changes in associative visual cortices, possibly linked with strengthened stability of resting-state networks.', 'Fast 3D ultrashort echo-time spiral projection imaging using golden-angle: A flexible protocol for in vivo mouse imaging at high magnetic field. Purpose: To develop a fast three-dimensional (3D) k-space encoding method based on spiral projection imaging (SPI) with an interleaved golden-angle approach and to validate this novel sequence on small animal models. Methods: A disk-like trajectory, in which each disk contained spirals, was developed. The 3D encoding was performed by tilting the disks with a golden angle. The sharpness was first calculated at different T*2 values. Then, the sharpness was measured on phantom using variable undersampling ratios. Finally, the sampling method was validated by whole brain time-of-flight angiography and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) enhanced free-breathing liver angiography on mouse. Results: The in vitro results demonstrated the robustness of the method for short T*2 and high undersampling ratios. In vivo experiments showed the ability to properly detect small vessels in the brain with an acquisition time shorter than 1 min. Free-breathing mice liver angiography showed the insensitivity of this protocol toward motions and flow artifacts, and enabled the visualization of liver motion during breathing. Conclusions: The method implemented here allowed fast 3D k-space sampling with a high undersampling ratio. Combining the advantages of center-out spirals with the flexibility of the golden angle approach could have major implications for real-time imaging.

Single-molecule imaging has changed the way we understand many biological mechanisms, particularly in neurobiology, by shedding light on intricate molecular events down to the nanoscale. However, current single-molecule studies in neuroscience have been limited to cultured neurons or organotypic slices, leaving as an open question the existence of fast receptor diffusion in intact brain tissue. Here, for the first time, we targeted dopamine receptors in vivo with functionalized quantum dots and were able to perform single-molecule tracking in acute rat brain slices. We propose a novel delocalized and non-inflammatory way of delivering nanoparticles (NPs) in vivo to the brain, which allowed us to label and track genetically engineered surface dopamine receptors in neocortical neurons, revealing inherent behaviour and receptor activity regulations. We thus propose a NP-based platform for single-molecule studies in the living brain, opening new avenues of research in physiological and pathological animal models.', 'Multiple simultaneous spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages: A rare entity. Background: In hospital databases, multiple simultaneous spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH-m) account for 0.7-5.6% of all ICHs. Their long-term outcome has never been systematically and prospectively investigated. We aimed at identifying the long-term outcome of patients with ICH-m. Methods: We prospectively recruited consecutive adults with ICH-m and followed them up for at least 4.5 years. We classified patients into the following 3 groups: (i) definite or probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), (ii) deep perforating vasculopathy (DPV) and (iii) unknown causes. Results: Of 562 consecutive patients with ICH, 32 had ICH-m (5.7%): 8 (25%) with probable CAA, 5 (16%) with DPV and 19 (59%) with ICH-m of undetermined cause. At the last visit (cumulative follow-up of 39.5 person-year), 27 patients (84%) had died, and 3 of the 5 survivors were independent. Late-onset seizures, recurrent ICH-m (symptomatic or not) and new brain microbleeds were mainly found in patients with probable CAA. Conclusions: ICH-m is a rare but extremely severe expression of ICH. Survivors with CAA are more likely to develop late seizures and new hemorrhagic lesions. Because of low survival rates, large multicenter cohort studies are needed for a better understanding of this rare condition.', 'From gut to brain: Microbiota depletion in mice as a tool to explore causality. ', 'Genetic influences on schizophrenia and subcortical brain volumes: Large-scale proof of concept. Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric illness with high heritability. Brain structure and function differ, on average, between people with schizophrenia and healthy individuals. As common genetic associations are emerging for both schizophrenia and brain imaging phenotypes, we can now use genome-wide data to investigate genetic overlap. Here we integrated results from common variant studies of schizophrenia (33,636 cases, 43,008 controls) and volumes of several (mainly subcortical) brain structures (11,840 subjects). We did not find evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia risk and subcortical volume measures either at the level of common variant genetic architecture or for single genetic markers. These results provide a proof of concept (albeit based on a limited set of structural brain measures) and define a roadmap for future studies investigating the genetic covariance between structural or functional brain phenotypes and risk for psychiatric disorders.', 'Functional brain imaging: What has it brought to our understanding of neuropathic pain? A special focus on allodynic pain mechanisms. Brain responses to nociception are well identified. The same is not true for allodynic pain, a strong painful sensation in response to touch or innocuous cold stimuli that may be experienced by patients with neuropathic pain. Brain (or spinal cord) reorganization that may explain this paradoxical perception still remains largely unknown. Allodynic pain is associated with abnormally increased activity in SII and in the anterior insular cortex, contralateral and/or ipsilateral to allodynia. Because a bilateral increase in activity has been repeatedly reported in these areas in nociceptive conditions, the observed activation during allodynia can explain that a physiologically nonpainful stimulus could be perceived by the damaged nervous system as a painful one. Both secondary somatosensory and insular cortices receive input from the thalamus, which is a major relay of sensory and spinothalamic pathways, the involvement of which is known to be crucial for the development of neuropathic pain. Both thalamic function and structure have been reported to be abnormal or impaired in neuropathic pain conditions including in the basal state, possibly explaining the spontaneous component of neuropathic pain. A further indication as to how the brain can create neuropathic pain response in SII and insular cortices stems from examples of diseases, including single-case reports in whom a focal brain lesion leads to central pain disappearance. Additional studies are required to certify the contribution of these areas to the disease processes, to disentangle abnormalities respectively related to pain and to deafferentation, and, in the future, to guide targeting of stimulation studies.', 'Short Meditation Trainings Enhance Non-REM Sleep Low-Frequency Oscillations. Study Objectives We have recently shown higher parietal-occipital EEG gamma activity during sleep in longterm meditators compared to meditation-naive individuals. This gamma increase was specific for NREM sleep, was present throughout the entire night and correlated with meditation expertise, thus suggesting underlying long-lasting neuroplastic changes induced through prolonged training. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroplastic changes acutely induced by 2 intensive days of different meditation practices in the same group of practitioners. We also repeated baseline recordings in a meditation-naive cohort to account for time effects on sleep EEG activity. Design High-density EEG recordings of human brain activity were acquired over the course of whole sleep nights following intervention. Setting Sound-attenuated sleep research room. Patients or Participants Twenty-four long-term meditators and twenty-four meditation-naïve controls. Interventions Two 8-h sessions of either a mindfulness-based meditation or a form of meditation designed to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, hereafter referred to as compassion meditation. Measurements and Results We found an increase in EEG low-frequency oscillatory activities (1-12 Hz, centered around 7-8 Hz) over prefrontal and left parietal electrodes across whole night NREM cycles. This power increase peaked early in the night and extended during the third cycle to highfrequencies up to the gamma range (25-40 Hz). There was no difference in sleep EEG activity between meditation styles in long-term meditators nor in the meditation naïve group across different time points. Furthermore, the prefrontal-parietal changes were dependent on meditation life experience. Conclusions This low-frequency prefrontal-parietal activation likely reflects acute, meditation-related plastic changes occurring during wakefulness, and may underlie a top-down regulation from frontal and anterior parietal areas to the posterior parietal and occipital regions showing chronic, long-lasting plastic changes in long-term meditators.', 'Development of the neurons controlling fertility in humans: New insights from 3D imaging and transparent fetal brains. Fertility in mammals is controlled by hypothalamic neurons that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). These neurons differentiate in the olfactory placodes during embryogenesis and migrate from the nose to the hypothalamus before birth. Information regarding this process in humans is sparse. Here, we adapted new tissue-clearing and whole-mount immunohistochemical techniques to entire human embryos/fetuses to meticulously study this system during the first trimester of gestation in the largest series of human fetuses examined to date. Combining these cutting-edge techniques with conventional immunohistochemistry, we provide the first chronological and quantitative analysis of GnRH neuron origins, differentiation and migration, as well as a 3D atlas of their distribution in the fetal brain. We reveal not only that the number of GnRHimmunoreactive neurons in humans is significantly higher than previously thought, but that GnRH cells migrate into several extrahypothalamic brain regions in addition to the hypothalamus. Their presence in these areas raises the possibility that GnRH has non-reproductive roles, creating new avenues for research on GnRH functions in cognitive, behavioral and physiological processes.', 'Texture-based markers from structural imaging correlate with motor handicap in Parkinson’s disease. There is a growing need for surrogate biomarkers for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Structural analysis using magnetic resonance imaging with T1-weighted sequences has the potential to quantify histopathological changes. Degeneration is typically measured by the volume and shape of morphological changes. However, these changes appear late in the disease, preventing their use as surrogate markers. We investigated texture changes in 108 individuals, divided into three groups, matched in terms of sex and age: (1) healthy controls (n = 32); (2) patients with early-stage PD (n = 39); and (3) patients with late-stage PD and severe L-dopa-related complications (n = 37). All patients were assessed in off-treatment conditions. Statistical analysis of first- and second-order texture features was conducted in the substantia nigra, striatum, thalamus and sub-thalamic nucleus. Regions of interest volumetry and voxel-based morphometry were performed for comparison. Significantly different texture features were observed between the three populations, with some showing a gradual linear progression between the groups. The volumetric changes in the two PD patient groups were not significantly different. Texture features were significantly associated with clinical scores for motor handicap. These results suggest that texture features, measured in the nigrostriatal pathway at PD diagnosis, may be useful in predicting clinical progression of motor handicap.', 'Genetic architecture of subcortical brain structures in 38,851 individuals. Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness, emotions and learning. We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets underlying brain development and disease.', \"Juvenile mild traumatic brain injury elicits distinct spatiotemporal astrocyte responses. Mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represents ~80% of all emergency room visits and increases the probability of developing long-term cognitive disorders in children. To date, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying post-mTBI cognitive dysfunction are unknown. Astrogliosis has been shown to significantly alter astrocytes' properties following brain injury, potentially leading to significant brain dysfunction. However, such alterations have never been investigated in the context of juvenile mTBI (jmTBI). A closed-head injury model was used to study jmTBI on postnatal-day 17 mice. Astrogliosis was evaluated using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and nestin immunolabeling in somatosensory cortex (SSC), dentate gyrus (DG), amygdala (AMY), and infralimbic area (ILA) of prefrontal cortex in both hemispheres from 1 to 30 days postinjury (dpi). In vivo T2-weighted-imaging (T2WI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed at 7 and 30 dpi to examine tissue level structural alterations. Increased GFAP-labeling was observed up to 30 dpi in the ipsilateral SSC, the initial site of the impact. However, vimentin and nestin expression was not perturbed by jmTBI. The morphology of GFAP positive cells was significantly altered in the SSC, DG, AMY, and ILA up to 7 dpi that some correlated with magnetic resonance imaging changes. T2WI and DTI values were significantly altered at 30 dpi within these brain regions most prominently in regions distant from the impact site. Our data show that jmTBI triggers changes in astrocytic phenotype with a distinct spatiotemporal pattern. We speculate that the presence and time course of astrogliosis may contribute to pathophysiological processes and long-term structural alterations following jmTBI.\", 'Four core properties of the human brain valuation system demonstrated in intracranial signals. Estimating the value of alternative options is a key process in decision-making. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging and monkey electrophysiology studies have identified brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), composing a value system. In the present study, in an effort to bridge across species and techniques, we investigated the neural representation of value ratings in 36 people with epilepsy, using intracranial electroencephalography. We found that subjective value was positively reflected in both vmPFC and lOFC high-frequency activity, plus several other brain regions, including the hippocampus. We then demonstrated that subjective value could be decoded (1) in pre-stimulus activity, (2) for various categories of items, (3) even during a distractive task and (4) as both linear and quadratic signals (encoding both value and confidence). Thus, our findings specify key functional properties of neural value signals (anticipation, generality, automaticity, quadraticity), which might provide insights into human irrational choice behaviors.', 'XTRACT - Standardised protocols for automated tractography in the human and macaque brain. We present a new software package with a library of standardised tractography protocols devised for the robust automated extraction of white matter tracts both in the human and the macaque brain. Using in vivo data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the UK Biobank and ex vivo data for the macaque brain datasets, we obtain white matter atlases, as well as atlases for tract endpoints on the white-grey matter boundary, for both species. We illustrate that our protocols are robust against data quality, generalisable across two species and reflect the known anatomy. We further demonstrate that they capture inter-subject variability by preserving tract lateralisation in humans and tract similarities stemming from twinship in the HCP cohort. Our results demonstrate that the presented toolbox will be useful for generating imaging-derived features in large cohorts, and in facilitating comparative neuroanatomy studies. The software, tractography protocols, and atlases are publicly released through FSL, allowing users to define their own tractography protocols in a standardised manner, further contributing to open science.', \"Epilepsy in LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy: An electro-clinico-radiological characterization. Objective: To delineate the epileptic phenotype of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (MD) and correlate it with the neuroradiological and muscle biopsy findings, as well as the functional motor phenotype. Methods: Clinical, electrophysiological, neuroradiological, and histopathological data of 25 patients with diagnosis of LAMA2-related MD were analyzed. Results: Epilepsy occurred in 36% of patients with LAMA2-related MD. Mean age at first seizure was 8\\xa0years. The most common presenting seizure type was focal-onset seizures with or without impaired awareness. Visual aura and autonomic signs, including vomiting, were frequently reported. Despite a certain degree of variability, bilateral occipital or temporo-occipital epileptiform abnormalities were by far the most commonly observed. Refractory epilepsy was found in 75% of these patients. Epilepsy in LAMA2-related MD was significantly more prevalent in those patients in whom the cortical malformations were more extensive. In contrast, the occurrence of epilepsy was not found to be associated with the patients' motor ability, the size of their white matter abnormalities, or the amount of residual merosin expressed on muscle. Significance: The epileptic phenotype of LAMA2-related MD is characterized by focal seizures with prominent visual and autonomic features associated with EEG abnormalities that predominate in the posterior quadrants. A consistent correlation between epileptic phenotype and neuroimaging was identified, suggesting that the extension of the polymicrogyria may serve as a predictor of epilepsy occurrence.\", 'NMDA-receptor antibodies alter cortical microcircuit dynamics. NMDA-receptor antibodies (NMDAR-Abs) cause an autoimmune encephalitis with a diverse range of EEG abnormalities. NMDAR-Abs are believed to disrupt receptor function, but how blocking this excitatory synaptic receptor can lead to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities-or even seizures-is poorly understood. Here we show that NMDAR-Abs change intrinsic cortical connections and neuronal population dynamics to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity and predispose brain dynamics to paroxysmal abnormalities. Based on local field potential recordings in a mouse model, we first validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we then identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in pediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we use the mouse model to show that NMDARAb- related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms when these key parameters are changed, even though the same parameter fluctuations are tolerated in the in silico model of the control condition. These findings offer mechanistic insights into circuit-level dysfunction induced by NMDAR-Ab.', 'Acute effects of bi-hemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation on the neuromuscular function of patients with chronic stroke: A randomized controlled study. Background: Muscle weakness in patients with chronic stroke is due to neuromuscular disorders such as muscle atrophy, loss of voluntary activation or weak muscle contractile properties which are majored by the imbalance of interhemispheric inhibition following stroke. In patients with chronic stroke, unilateral transcranial direct current stimulation improved the maximal isometric strength of paretic knee extensors, but bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation failed to improve concentric strength. This study aimed to assess if a bilateral current stimulation improves isometric maximal strength, voluntary activation and contractile properties of knee extensors in patients with chronic stroke. Methods: Thirteen patients with chronic stroke and eight young healthy individuals participated in this randomized, simple-blinded, crossover study that included two experimental sessions: one with sham bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation and another with effective bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation (20 min, 2 mA). In the stroke patients, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex of the affected hemisphere and the cathode over the contralateral primary motor cortex. In healthy participants, the brain side targeted by the anode and the cathode was randomly assigned. In each session, participants performed three assessments of strength, voluntary activation and contractile properties: before, during and after effective/sham bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation. Findings: Bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation had no effect on any neuromuscular assessments in both groups (All P values > 0.05, partial eta-squares varied from 0.02 to 0.06). Interpretation: A single session of bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation did not compensate muscular weakness of knee extensors in patients with chronic stroke.', \"Transdiagnostic commonalities and differences in resting state functional connectivity of the default mode network in schizophrenia and major depression. Schizophrenia and depression are prevalent psychiatric disorders, but their underlying neural bases remains poorly understood. Neuroimaging evidence has pointed towards the relevance of functional connectivity aberrations in default mode network (DMN) hubs, dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, in both disorders, but commonalities and differences in resting state functional connectivity of those two regions across disorders has not been formally assessed. Here, we took a transdiagnostic approach to investigate resting state functional connectivity of those two regions in 75 patients with schizophrenia and 82 controls from 4 scanning sites and 102 patients with depression and 106 controls from 3 sites. Our results demonstrate common dysconnectivity patterns as indexed by a significant reduction of functional connectivity between precuneus and bilateral superior parietal lobe in schizophrenia and depression. Furthermore, our findings highlight diagnosis-specific connectivity reductions of the parietal operculum in schizophrenia relative to depression. In light of evidence that points towards the importance of the DMN for social cognitive abilities and well documented impairments of social interaction in both patient groups, it is conceivable that the observed transdiagnostic connectivity alterations may contribute to interpersonal difficulties, but this could not be assessed directly in our study as measures of social behavior were not available. Given the operculum's role in somatosensory integration, diagnosis-specific connectivity reductions may indicate a pathophysiological mechanism for basic self-disturbances that is characteristic of schizophrenia, but not depression.\", 'Dysfunctional connectivity in posterior brain regions involved in cognitive control in schizophrenia: A preliminary fMRI study. Cognitive control, the ability to use goal-directed information to guide behaviour, is impaired in schizophrenia, and mainly related to dysfunctions within the fronto-posterior brain network. However, cognitive control is a broad cognitive function encompassing distinct sub-processes that, until now, studies have failed to separate and relate to specific brain regions. The goal of this preliminary fMRI study is to investigate the functional specialization of posterior brain regions, and their functional interaction with lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) regions, in schizophrenia. Fourteen healthy participants and 15 matched schizophrenic patients participated in this fMRI study. We used a task paradigm that differentiates two cognitive control sub-processes according to the temporal framing of information, namely the control of immediate context (present cues) vs. temporal episode (past instructions). We found that areas activated during contextual and episodic controls were in dorsal posterior regions and that activations did not significantly differ between schizophrenic patients and healthy participants. However, while processing contextual signals, patients with schizophrenia failed to show decreased connectivity between caudal LPFC and areas located in ventral posterior regions. The absence of group difference in the functional specialization of posterior regions is difficult to interpret due to our small sample size. One interpretation for our connectivity results is that patients present an inefficient extinction of posterior regions involved in attention shifting by prefrontal areas involved in the top-down control of contextual signals. Further studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to ascertain those observations.', 'Age-related impairment of metabovascular coupling during cortical spreading depolarizations. ', 'The influence of sex information into spoken words: a mismatch negativity (MMN) study. When exposed to a spoken message, a listener takes into account several sources of linguistic and indexical information. Using the mismatch negativity (MMN) response, we examined whether the indexical information about the sex of the speaker influenced the processing of semantically gendered spoken words. Female participants listened two semantically gendered French words, one masculine and one feminine representing human beings, said either by five male or by five female speakers. The opposite sex voices produced an enhancement of MMN response. In line with interactive connections between indexical and linguistic information processing through activating lexical memory traces, the results showed more pronounced MMN response when the sex of the speaker matched with the gender of the word. Furthermore, there was a later detection of the incongruence between the sex information about the speaker and the gender of the word, shown by an enhancement of MMN response. Overall, these findings suggest that the listeners integrate the indexical information about the sex of the speakers both at the lexical selection level and at a higher-level processing such as the grammatical access.', 'The impact of a multi-domain intervention on cerebral glucose metabolism: analysis from the randomized ancillary FDG PET MAPT trial. Background: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was designed to assess the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, multidomain intervention (MI), or a combination of both on cognition. Although the MAPT study was negative, an effect of MI in maintaining cognitive functions compared to placebo group was showed in positive amyloid subjects. A FDG PET study (MAPT-NI) was implemented to test the impact of MI on brain glucose metabolism. Methods: MAPT-NI was a randomized, controlled parallel-group single-center study, exploring the effect of MI on brain glucose metabolism. Participants were non-demented and had memory complaints, limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living, or slow gait. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to “MI group” or “No MI group.” The MI consisted of group sessions focusing on 3 domains: cognitive stimulation, physical activity, nutrition, and a preventive consultation. [18F]FDG PET scans were performed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. The primary objective was to evaluate the MI effect on brain glucose metabolism assessed by [18F]FDG PET imaging at 6 months. The primary outcome was the quantification of regional metabolism rate for glucose in cerebral regions involved early in Alzheimer disease by relative semi-quantitative SUVr (FDG-based AD biomarker). An exploratory voxel-wise analysis was performed to assess the effect of MI on brain glucose metabolism without anatomical hypothesis. Results: The intention-to-treat population included 67 subjects (34 in the MI group and 33 in the No MI group. No significant MI effect was observed on primary outcome at 6 months. In the exploratory voxel-wise analysis, we observed a difference in favor of MI group on the change of cerebral glucose metabolism in limbic lobe (right hippocampus, right posterior cingulate, left posterior parahippocampal gyrus) at 6 months. Conclusions: MI failed to show an effect on metabolism in FDG-based AD biomarker, but exploratory analysis suggested positive effect on limbic system metabolism. This finding could suggest a delay effect of MI on AD progression. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT01513252.', 'The combination of stereo-EEG and radiofrequency ablation. SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG-guided RFTC), a combination of Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFTC), has been performed since 2001 in drug resistant epilepsy. The interest of this procedure is to aim at total or partial destruction of the epileptogenic zone, as tailored in each individual patient by the SEEG exploration. These multiple SEEG-guided RFTC lesions of epileptic foci are produced by using a radiofrequency generator connected to the electrode contacts. This review summarizes the results of SEEG-guided RFTC reported in 251 patients. This procedure appears to be safe since complications are rare, minor and usually reversible, which is explained by the use of functional electrical stimulations before RFTC. It makes it also possible to produce RF lesions located very close to cortical areas having a high functional value or being poorly accessible to a conventional surgical procedure. Even if seizure outcome is not as good as results of surgery, 41% of the patients are responders at 12 months with several seizure free patients. The benefit-risk ratio of the SEEG-guided RFTC procedure proved to be particularly favorable for the patients presenting with epileptogenic cortical malformation of development (nodular heterotopy as well as focal cortical dysplasia) and for those in whom surgery is not feasible or risky. For the patients in whom surgery is feasible, SEEG-guided RFTC could be used as a first step, as a predictive therapeutic test before resective surgery.', 'Developmental trajectories of neuroanatomical alterations associated with the 16p11.2 Copy Number Variations. Most of human genome is present in two copies (maternal and paternal). However, segments of the genome can be deleted or duplicated, and many of these genomic variations (known as Copy Number Variants) are associated with psychiatric disorders. 16p11.2 copy number variants (breakpoint 4–5) confer high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and are associated with structural brain alterations of large effect-size. Methods used in previous studies were unable to investigate the onset of these alterations and whether they evolve with age. In this study, we aim at characterizing age-related effects of 16p11.2 copy number variants by analyzing a group with a broad age range including younger individuals. A large normative developmental dataset was used to accurately adjust for effects of age. We normalized volumes of segmented brain regions as well as volumes of each voxel defined by tensor-based morphometry. Results show that the total intracranial volumes, the global gray and white matter volumes are respectively higher and lower in deletion and duplication carriers compared to control subjects at 4.5 years of age. These differences remain stable through childhood, adolescence and adulthood until 23 years of age (range: 0.5 to 1.0 Z-score). Voxel-based results are consistent with previous findings in 16p11.2 copy number variant carriers, including increased volume in the calcarine cortex and insula in deletions, compared to controls, with an inverse effect in duplication carriers (1.0 Z-score). All large effect-size voxel-based differences are present at 4.5 years and seem to remain stable until the age of 23. Our results highlight the stability of a neuroimaging endophenotype over 2 decades during which neurodevelopmental symptoms evolve at a rapid pace.', 'Effects of eight neuropsychiatric copy number variants on human brain structure. Many copy number variants (CNVs) confer risk for the same range of neurodevelopmental symptoms and psychiatric conditions including autism and schizophrenia. Yet, to date neuroimaging studies have typically been carried out one mutation at a time, showing that CNVs have large effects on brain anatomy. Here, we aimed to characterize and quantify the distinct brain morphometry effects and latent dimensions across 8 neuropsychiatric CNVs. We analyzed T1-weighted MRI data from clinically and non-clinically ascertained CNV carriers (deletion/duplication) at the 1q21.1 (n = 39/28), 16p11.2 (n = 87/78), 22q11.2 (n = 75/30), and 15q11.2 (n = 72/76) loci as well as 1296 non-carriers (controls). Case-control contrasts of all examined genomic loci demonstrated effects on brain anatomy, with deletions and duplications showing mirror effects at the global and regional levels. Although CNVs mainly showed distinct brain patterns, principal component analysis (PCA) loaded subsets of CNVs on two latent brain dimensions, which explained 32 and 29% of the variance of the 8 Cohen’s d maps. The cingulate gyrus, insula, supplementary motor cortex, and cerebellum were identified by PCA and multi-view pattern learning as top regions contributing to latent dimension shared across subsets of CNVs. The large proportion of distinct CNV effects on brain morphology may explain the small neuroimaging effect sizes reported in polygenic psychiatric conditions. Nevertheless, latent gene brain morphology dimensions will help subgroup the rapidly expanding landscape of neuropsychiatric variants and dissect the heterogeneity of idiopathic conditions.', \"Transcription factor EB overexpression prevents neurodegeneration in experimental synucleinopathies. The synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) - characterized by α-synuclein intracytoplasmic inclusions into, respectively, neurons and oligodendrocytes - are associated with impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathways (ALP). Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies.\", \"No structural differences are revealed by VBM in 'de Novo' Parkinsonian patients. The identification of brain morphological alterations in newly diagnosed PD patients (i.e. 'de novo') could potentially serve as a biomarker and accelerate diagnosis. However, presently no consensus exists in the literature possibly due to several factors: small size cohorts, differences in segmentation techniques or bad control of false positive rates. In this study, we use the CAT12 pipeline, to seek for morphological brain differences in gray and white matter of 66 controls and 144 de novo PD patients from the PPMI database. Moreover, we search for subcortical structure differences using the VolBrain pipeline. We found no structural brain differences in this de novo Parkinsonian population, neither in tissues using a whole brain analysis nor in any of nine subcortical structures analyzed separately. We conclude that some results published in the literature may appear as false positives and we contest their reproductibility.\", 'The challenge of mapping the human connectome based on diffusion tractography. Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations.', 'Predicting hemispheric dominance for language production in healthy individuals using support vector machine. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to assess hemispheric pattern of language dominance of 47 individuals categorized as non-typical for language from their hemispheric functional laterality index (HFLI) measured on a sentence minus word-list production fMRI-BOLD contrast map. The SVM classifier was trained at discriminating between Dominant and Non-Dominant hemispheric language production activation pattern on a group of 250 participants previously identified as Typicals (HFLI strongly leftward). Then, SVM was applied to each hemispheric language activation pattern of 47 non-typical individuals. The results showed that at least one hemisphere (left or right) was found to be Dominant in every, except 3 individuals, indicating that the “dominant” type of functional organization is the most frequent in non-typicals. Specifically, left hemisphere dominance was predicted in all non-typical right-handers (RH) and in 57.4% of non-typical left-handers (LH). When both hemisphere classifications were jointly considered, four types of brain patterns were observed. The most often predicted pattern (51%) was left-dominant (Dominant left-hemisphere and Non-Dominant right-hemisphere), followed by right-dominant (23%, Dominant right-hemisphere and Non-Dominant left-hemisphere) and co-dominant (19%, 2 Dominant hemispheres) patterns. Co-non-dominant was rare (6%, 2 Non-Dominant hemispheres), but was normal variants of hemispheric specialization. In RH, only left-dominant (72%) and co-dominant patterns were detected, while for LH, all types were found, although with different occurrences. Among the 10 LH with a strong rightward HFLI, 8 had a right-dominant brain pattern. Whole-brain analysis of the right-dominant pattern group confirmed that it exhibited a functional organization strictly mirroring that of left-dominant pattern group.

The PeriPersonal Space (PPS) has been defined as the space surrounding the body, where physical interactions with elements of the environment take place. As our world is social in nature, recent evidence revealed the complex modulation of social factors onto PPS representation. In light of the growing interest in the field, in this review we take a close look at the experimental approaches undertaken to assess the impact of social factors onto PPS representation. Our social world also influences the personal space (PS), a concept stemming from social psychology, defined as the space we keep between us and others to avoid discomfort. Here we analytically compare PPS and PS with the aim of understanding if and how they relate to each other. At the behavioral level, the multiplicity of experimental methodologies, whether well-established or novel, lead to somewhat divergent results and interpretations. Beyond behavior, we review physiological and neural signatures of PPS representation to discuss how interoceptive signals could contribute to PPS representation, as well as how these internal signals could shape the neural responses of PPS representation. In particular, by merging exteroceptive information from the environment and internal signals that come from the body, PPS may promote an integrated representation of the self, as distinct from the environment and the others. We put forward that integrating internal and external signals in the brain for perception of proximal environmental stimuli may also provide us with a better understanding of the processes at play during social interactions. Adopting such an integrative stance may offer novel insights about PPS representation in a social world. Finally, we discuss possible links between PPS research and social cognition, a link that may contribute to the understanding of intentions and feelings of others around us and promote appropriate social interactions.', 'In vitro α-synuclein neurotoxicity and spreading among neurons and astrocytes using Lewy body extracts from Parkinson disease brains. Synucleinopathies are a group of diseases characterized by the presence of intracellular protein aggregates containing α-synuclein (α-syn). While α-syn aggregates have been shown to induce multimodal cellular dysfunctions, uptake and transport mechanisms remain unclear. Using high-content imaging on cortical neurons and astrocytes, we here define the kinetics of neuronal and astrocytic abnormalities induced by human-derived α-syn aggregates grounding the use of such system to identify and test putative therapeutic compounds. We then aimed at characterizing uptake and transport mechanisms using primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes either in single well or in microfluidic chambers allowing connection between cells and cell-types. We report that astrocytes take up α-syn-aggregates far more efficiently than neurons through an endocytic event. We also highlight that active α-syn transport occurs between cells and any cell-types. Of special interest regarding the disease, we also show that uptake and spreading of α-syn from astrocytes to neurons can lead to neuronal death. Altogether, we here show that patients-derived α-synuclein aggregates, which are taken up by neurons and astrocytes, induce a differential endogenous response in the two cell types including a peculiar astrocytic toxic gain-of-function that leads to neuronal death.', 'Oral ambroxol increases brain glucocerebrosidase activity in a nonhuman primate. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gene are related to both Parkinson disease (PD) and Gaucher disease (GD). In both cases, the condition is associated with deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme encoded by GBA1. Ambroxol is a small molecule chaperone that has been shown in mice to cross the blood-brain barrier, increase GCase activity and reduce alpha-synuclein protein levels. In this study, we analyze the effect of ambroxol treatment on GCase activity in healthy nonhuman primates. We show that daily administration of ambroxol results in increased brain GCase activity. Our work further indicates that ambroxol should be investigated as a novel therapy for both PD and neuronopathic GD in humans.', 'Progress in the characterization of insulin-like peptides in aphids: Immunohistochemical mapping of ILP4. Aphids were the first animals described as photoperiodic due to their seasonal switch from viviparous parthenogenesis to sexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis) caused by the shortening of the photoperiod in autumn. This switch produces a single sexual generation of oviparous females and males that mate and lay diapausing cold-resistant eggs that can overcome the unfavourable environmental conditions typical of winter in temperate regions. Previous studies have hinted at a possible implication of two insulin-like peptides (ILP1 and ILP4) in the aphid seasonal response, changing their expression levels between different photoperiodic conditions. Moreover, in situ localization of their transcripts in particular neurosecretory cells (NSCs) in the aphid brain supported the idea that these neuropeptides could correspond to the formerly called virginoparin, an uncharacterized factor originally proposed to be transported directly to the aphid embryos to promote their development as parthenogenetic individuals. To further investigate the fate of these ILPs, we raised a specific antiserum against one of them (ILP4) and mapped this neuropeptide by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae aphids. Coincident with in situ localization, our results show that ILP4 is synthesized in two groups (one in each brain hemisphere) of four neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis (NSC group I) and then it is transported outside the brain to the corpora cardiaca. From there, three nerves (two laterals and one medial) transport it to the abdomen. Although no precise site of release has been found, the terminations of these nerves near the germaria would be compatible with the proposal of a direct connection between group I of NSCs and the reproductive system by localized release. In addition, we detected some collateral arborizations originating from the eight NSCs going to the pars lateralis, where clock neurons and some photoreceptors have been previously localized, suggesting a possible communication between the circadian and photoperiodic systems.', 'CB1R-dependent regulation of astrocyte physiology and astrocyte-neuron interactions. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in a variety of brain functions, mainly through the activation of the type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R). CB1R are highly expressed throughout the brain at different structural, cellular and subcellular locations and its activity and expression levels have a direct impact in synaptic activity and behavior. In the last few decades, astrocytes have arisen as active players of brain physiology through their participation in the tripartite synapse and through their metabolic interaction with neurons. Here, we discuss some of the mechanisms by which astroglial CB1R at different subcellular locations, regulate astrocyte calcium signals and have an impact on gliotransmission and metabolic regulation. In addition, we discuss evidence pointing at astrocytes as potential important sources of endocannabinoid synthesis and release. Thus, we summarize recent findings that add further complexity and establish that the ECS is a fundamental effector of astrocyte functions in the brain.', 'The squirrel monkey model in clinical neuroscience. Clinical neuroscience research relying on animal models brought valuable translational insights into the function and pathologies of the human brain. The anatomical, physiological, and behavioural similarities between humans and mammals have prompted researchers to study cerebral mechanisms at different levels to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of biomedical research uses rodent models, which are easily manipulable and have a broadly resembling organisation to the human nervous system but cannot satisfactorily mimic some disorders. For these disorders, macaque monkeys have been used as they have a more comparable central nervous system. Still, this research has been hampered by limitations, including high costs and reduced samples. This review argues that a squirrel monkey model might bridge the gap by complementing translational research from rodents, macaque, and humans. With the advent of promising new methods such as ultrasound imaging, tool miniaturisation, and a shift towards open science, the squirrel monkey model represents a window of opportunity that will potentially fuel new translational discoveries in the diagnosis and treatment of brain pathologies.', 'Molecular genetic aetiology of general cognitive function is enriched in evolutionarily conserved regions. Differences in general cognitive function have been shown to be partly heritable and to show genetic correlations with several psychiatric and physical disease states. However, to date, few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated genome-wide significance, hampering efforts aimed at determining which genetic variants are most important for cognitive function and which regions drive the genetic associations between cognitive function and disease states. Here, we combine multiple large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, from the CHARGE cognitive consortium (n =53 949) and UK Biobank (n=36 035), to partition the genome into 52 functional annotations and an additional 10 annotations describing tissuespecific histone marks. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression we show that, in two measures of cognitive function, SNPs associated with cognitive function cluster in regions of the genome that are under evolutionary negative selective pressure. These conserved regions contained ∼2.6% of the SNPs from each GWAS but accounted for ∼ 40% of the SNP-based heritability. The results suggest that the search for causal variants associated with cognitive function, and those variants that exert a pleiotropic effect between cognitive function and health, will be facilitated by examining these enriched regions.', 'Lifelong Persistence of Toxoplasma Cysts: A Questionable Dogma?. It is believed that infection by Toxoplasma gondii triggers a lifelong protective immunity due to the persistence of parasitic cysts which induce immunoprotection against reinfection. A review of the scientific literature since the 1950s did not yield any definitive data regarding the duration of cysts in the host or the presence of lifelong protective immunity, which led us to question this dogma. We put forward the hypothesis that sustained immunity to T. gondii requires repeated antigenic stimulations. The decline of seroprevalence recently observed in many countries might contribute to explain the loss of immunity. We address the potential consequences of this phenomenon, should it persist and worsen.', 'Impact of Head-of-Bed Posture on Brain Oxygenation in Patients with Acute Brain Injury: A Prospective Cohort Study. Background: Therapeutic head positioning plays a role in the management of patients with acute brain injury. Although intracranial pressure (ICP) is typically lower in an upright posture than in a flat position, limited data exist concerning the effect of upright positioning on brain oxygenation and circulation. We sought to determine the impact of supine (0°) and semirecumbent (15° and 30°) postures on ICP, brain oxygenation, and brain circulation. Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted between February 2012 and September 2015. Twenty-three patients with severe acute brain injury were successively observed at head elevations of 30°, 15°, and 0°. Postural-induced changes in ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, brain tissue oxygenation pressure, and transcranial Doppler findings were simultaneously measured during three repeated experiments: 24\\xa0h after admission to the intensive care unit (exp1), 24\\xa0h later (exp2), and 96\\xa0h later (exp3). Cerebral perfusion pressure, arterial blood gases, hemoglobin content, and body temperature remained unchanged during the three experiments. Results: Using linear random-slope mixed models, we found that during the early phase of acute brain injury (exp1), lowering the head posture from 30° to 15°, and then to 0°, was associated with a gradual mean ICP increase of 2.6\\xa0mm Hg (1.4–3.7\\xa0mm Hg; P < 0.001); and from 30° to 0°, an increase of 7.4\\xa0mm Hg (6.3–8.6\\xa0mm Hg; P < 0.001). Furthermore, brain tissue oxygenation pressure and mean blood flow velocity improved when the head posture was lowered from 30° to 0° by 1.2\\xa0mm Hg (0.2–2.3\\xa0mm Hg) and 4.1\\xa0cm/s (0.0–8.2\\xa0cm/s), respectively (both P < 0.05). Conclusions: Changing the positioning of stable patients with acute brain injury resulted in opposite changes of ICP versus brain oxygenation and circulation. This information supports the concept of an individualized approach to head positioning that is based on the multimodal monitoring of brain parameters.', 'Electrophysiological underpinnings of reward processing: Are we exploiting the full potential of EEG?. Understanding how the brain processes reward is an important and complex endeavor, which has involved the use of a range of complementary neuroimaging tools, including electroencephalography (EEG). EEG has been praised for its high temporal resolution but, because the signal recorded at the scalp is a mixture of brain activities, it is often considered to have poor spatial resolution. Besides, EEG data analysis has most often relied on event-related potentials (ERPs) which cancel out non-phase locked oscillatory activity, thus limiting the functional discriminative power of EEG attainable through spectral analyses. Because these three dimensions -temporal, spatial and spectral- have been unequally leveraged in reward studies, we argue that the full potential of EEG has not been exploited. To back up our claim, we first performed a systematic survey of EEG studies assessing reward processing. Specifically, we report on the nature of the cognitive processes investigated (i.e., reward anticipation or reward outcome processing) and the methods used to collect and process the EEG data (i.e., event-related potential, time-frequency or source analyses). A total of 359 studies involving healthy subjects and the delivery of monetary rewards were surveyed. We show that reward anticipation has been overlooked (88% of studies investigated reward outcome processing, while only 24% investigated reward anticipation), and that time-frequency and source analyses (respectively reported by 19% and 12% of the studies) have not been widely adopted by the field yet, with ERPs still being the dominant methodology (92% of the studies). We argue that this focus on feedback-related ERPs provides a biased perspective on reward processing, by ignoring reward anticipation processes as well as a large part of the information contained in the EEG signal. Finally, we illustrate with selected examples how addressing these issues could benefit the field, relying on approaches combining time-frequency analyses, blind source separation and source localization.', 'Common genetic variation indicates separate causes for periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (WMH; PVWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) are regional classifications of WMH and reflect proposed differences in cause. In the first study, to date, we undertook genomewide association analyses of DWMH and PVWMH to show that these phenotypes have different genetic underpinnings. METHODS: Participants were aged 45 years and older, free of stroke and dementia. We conducted genome-wide association analyses of PVWMH and DWMH in 26,654 participants from CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology), ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro-Imaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis), and the UKB (UK Biobank). Regional correlations were investigated using the genome-wide association analyses -pairwise method. Cross-trait genetic correlations between PVWMH, DWMH, stroke, and dementia were estimated using LDSC. RESULTS: In the discovery and replication analysis, for PVWMH only, we found associations on chromosomes 2 (NBEAL), 10q23.1 (TSPAN14/FAM231A), and 10q24.33 (SH3PXD2A). In the much larger combined meta-analysis of all cohorts, we identified ten significant regions for PVWMH: chromosomes 2 (3 regions), 6, 7, 10 (2 regions), 13, 16, and 17q23.1. New loci of interest include 7q36.1 (NOS3) and 16q24.2. In both the discovery/replication and combined analysis, we found genomewide significant associations for the 17q25.1 locus for both DWMH and PVWMH. Using gene-based association analysis, 19 genes across all regions were identified for PVWMH only, including the new genes: CALCRL (2q32.1), KLHL24 (3q27.1), VCAN (5q27.1), and POLR2F (22q13.1). Thirteen genes in the 17q25.1 locus were significant for both phenotypes. More extensive genetic correlations were observed for PVWMH with small vessel ischemic stroke. There were no associations with dementia for either phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms these phenotypes have distinct and also shared genetic architectures. Genetic analyses indicated PVWMH was more associated with ischemic stroke whilst DWMH loci were implicated in vascular, astrocyte, and neuronal function. Our study confirms these phenotypes are distinct neuroimaging classifications and identifies new candidate genes associated with PVWMH only.', 'Consequences of NMDA receptor deficiency can be rescued in the adult brain. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are required to shape activity-dependent connections in the developing and adult brain. Impaired NMDAR signalling through genetic or environmental insults causes a constellation of neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest as intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, or schizophrenia. It is not clear whether the developmental impacts of NMDAR dysfunction can be overcome by interventions in adulthood. This question is paramount for neurodevelopmental disorders arising from mutations that occur in the GRIN genes, which encode NMDAR subunits, and the broader set of mutations that disrupt NMDAR function. We developed a mouse model where a congenital loss-of-function allele of Grin1 can be restored to wild type by gene editing with Cre recombinase. Rescue of NMDARs in adult mice yields surprisingly robust improvements in cognitive functions, including those that are refractory to treatment with current medications. These results suggest that neurodevelopmental disorders arising from NMDAR deficiency can be effectively treated in adults.', 'Differential effects of non-dual and focused attention meditations on the formation of automatic perceptual habits in expert practitioners. Non-dual meditation aims to undo maladaptive cognitive and affective patterns by recognizing their constructed and transient nature. We previously found high-amplitude spontaneous gamma (25–40 Hz) oscillatory activity during such practice. Nonetheless, it is unclear how this meditation state differs from other practices, in terms of perceptual information processing. Here, we hypothesized that non-dual meditation can downregulate the automatic formation of perceptual habits. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded EEG from expert Buddhist meditation practitioners and matched novices to measure two components of the auditory evoked response: the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and the Late Frontal Negativity (LFN), a potential observed at a latency sensitive to attentional engagement to the auditory environment, during the practices of Open Presence (OP) and Focused Attention (FA), as well as during a control state, in the context of a passive oddball paradigm. We found an increase in gamma oscillatory power during both meditation states in expert practitioners and an interaction between states and groups in the amplitude of the MMN. A further investigation identified the specific interplay between the MMN and the LFN as a possible marker to differentiate the two meditation states as a function of expertise. In experts, the MMN increased during FA, compared to OP, while the opposite pattern was observed at the LFN latency. We propose that the state of OP in experts is characterized by increased sensory monitoring and reduced perceptual inferences compared to FA. This study represents a first attempt to describe the impact of non-dual meditation states on the regulation of automatic brain predictive processes.', 'The neuronal keepers of our dreams identified: Are they a target of Parkinson disease?. ', 'Have (R)-[<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 challengers fulfilled the promise? A scoping review of clinical TSPO PET studies. Purpose: The prototypical TSPO radiotracer (R)-[11C]PK11195 has been used in humans for more than thirty years to visualize neuroinflammation in several pathologies. Alternative radiotracers have been developed to improve signal-to-noise ratio and started to be tested clinically in 2008. Here we examined the scientific value of these “(R)-[11C]PK11195 challengers” in clinical research to determine if they could supersede (R)-[11C]PK11195. Methods: A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) search was performed (up to end of year 2020) to extract publications reporting TSPO PET in patients with identified pathologies, excluding studies in healthy subjects and methodological studies. Results: Of the 288 publications selected, 152 used 13 challengers, and 142 used (R)-[11C]PK11195. Over the last 20\\xa0years, the number of (R)-[11C]PK11195 studies remained stable (6 ± 3 per year), but was surpassed by the total number of challenger studies for the last 6\\xa0years. In total, 3914 patients underwent a TSPO PET scan, and 47% (1851 patients) received (R)-[11C]PK11195. The 2 main challengers were [11C]PBR28 (24%—938 patients) and [18F]FEPPA (11%—429 patients). Only one-in-ten patients (11%—447) underwent 2 TSPO scans, among whom 40 (1%) were scanned with 2 different TSPO radiotracers. Conclusions: Generally, challengers confirmed disease-specific initial (R)-[11C]PK11195 findings. However, while their better signal-to-noise ratio seems particularly useful in diseases with moderate and widespread neuroinflammation, most challengers present an allelic-dependent (Ala147Thr polymorphism) TSPO binding and genetic stratification is hindering their clinical implementation. As new challengers, insensitive to TSPO human polymorphism, are about to enter clinical evaluation, we propose this systematic review to be regularly updated (living review).', 'The lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2A promotes autophagic flux and prevents SNCA-induced Parkinson disease-like symptoms in the Drosophila brain. The autophagy-lysosome pathway plays a fundamental role in the clearance of aggregated proteins and protection against cellular stress and neurodegenerative conditions. Alterations in autophagy processes, including macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), have been described in Parkinson disease (PD). CMA is a selective autophagic process that depends on LAMP2A (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A), a mammal and bird-specific membrane glycoprotein that translocates cytosolic proteins containing a KFERQ-like peptide motif across the lysosomal membrane. Drosophila reportedly lack CMA and use endosomal microautophagy (eMI) as an alternative selective autophagic process. Here we report that neuronal expression of human LAMP2A protected Drosophila against starvation and oxidative stress, and delayed locomotor decline in aging flies without extending their lifespan. LAMP2A also prevented the progressive locomotor and oxidative defects induced by neuronal expression of PD-associated human SNCA (synuclein alpha) with alanine-to-proline mutation at position 30 (SNCAA30P). Using KFERQ-tagged fluorescent biosensors, we observed that LAMP2A expression stimulated selective autophagy in the adult brain and not in the larval fat body, but did not increase this process under starvation conditions. Noteworthy, we found that neurally expressed LAMP2A markedly upregulated levels of Drosophila Atg5, a key macroautophagy initiation protein, and that it increased the density of Atg8a/LC3-positive puncta, which reflects the formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, LAMP2A efficiently prevented accumulation of the autophagy defect marker Ref(2)P/p62 in the adult brain under acute oxidative stress. These results indicate that LAMP2A can potentiate autophagic flux in the Drosophila brain, leading to enhanced stress resistance and neuroprotection.

Background: The treatment of depression remains a challenge since at least 40% of patients do not respond to initial antidepressant therapy and 20% present chronic symptoms (more than 2 years despite standard treatment administered correctly). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy but still not ideal. Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), which has only been used recently in clinical practice, could have a faster and more intense effect compared to conventional protocols, including 10-Hz high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS). However, no controlled study has so far highlighted the superiority of iTBS in resistant unipolar depression. Methods/design: This paper focuses on the design of a randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-centre study with two parallel arms, carried out in France, in an attempt to assess the efficacy of an iTBS protocol versus a standard HF- rTMS protocol. Sixty patients aged between 18 and 75 years of age will be enrolled. They must be diagnosed with major depressive disorder persisting despite treatment with two antidepressants at an effective dose over a period of 6 weeks during the current episode. The study will consist of two phases: a treatment phase comprising 20 sessions of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, localised via a neuronavigation system and a 6-month longitudinal follow-up. The primary endpoint will be the number of responders per group, defined by a decrease of at least 50% in the initial score on the Montgomery and Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) at the end of rTMS sessions. The secondary endpoints will be: response rate 1 month after rTMS sessions; number of remissions defined by a MADRS score of <8 at the endpoint and 1 month after; the number of responses and remissions maintained over the next 6 months; quality of life; and the presence of predictive markers of the therapeutic response: clinical (dimensional scales), neuropsychological (evaluation of cognitive functions), motor (objective motor testing) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measurements). Discussion: The purpose of our study is to check the assumption of iTBS superiority in the management of unipolar depression and we will discuss its effect over time. In case of a significant increase in the number of therapeutic responses with a prolonged effect, the iTBS protocol could be considered a first-line protocol in resistant unipolar depression.

Registered on 17 February 2015 at http://clinicaltrials.gov.', \"“Embodied” language processing: Mental motor imagery aptitude predicts word-definition skill for high but not for low imageable words in adolescents. Our study was designed to test a recent proposal by Cayol and Nazir (2020), according to which language processing takes advantage of motor system “emulators”. An emulator is a brain mechanism that learns the causal relationship between an action and its sensory consequences. Emulators predict the outcome of a motor command in terms of its sensory reafference and serve monitoring ongoing movements. For the purpose of motor planning/learning, emulators can “run offline”, decoupled from sensory input and motor output. Such offline simulations are equivalent to mental imagery (Grush, 2004). If language processing can profit from the associative-memory network of emulators, mental-imagery-aptitude should predict language skills. However, this should hold only for language content that is imageable. We tested this assumption in typically developing adolescents using two motor-imagery paradigms. One that measured participant's error in estimating their motor ability, and another that measured the time to perform a mental simulation. When the time to perform a mental simulation is taken as measure, mental-imagery-aptitude does indeed selectively predict word-definition performance for high imageable words. These results provide an alternative position relative to the question of why language processes recruit modality-specific brain regions and support the often-hypothesized link between language and motor skills.\", \"Prevention of tau seeding and propagation by immunotherapy with a central tau epitope antibody. Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intraneuronal accumulation of aggregated tau. The staging of this neurodegenerative process is well established for Alzheimer's disease as well as for other tauopathies. The stereotypical pattern of tau pathology in these diseases is consistent with the hypothesis that the tau protein can spread in a 'prion-like' manner. It proposes that extracellular pathological tau species can transmit pathology from cell to cell. Accordingly, by targeting these spreading species with therapeutic antibodies one should be able to slow or halt the progression of tau pathology. To be effective, antibodies should neutralize the pathological species present in Alzheimer's disease brains and block their cell-to-cell spread. To evaluate both aspects, tau antibody D, which recognizes an epitope in the central region of tau, and was selected for its outstanding ability to block tau seeding in cell based assays, was used in this study. Here, we addressed two fundamental questions: (i) can this anti-tau antibody neutralize the pathological species present in Alzheimer's disease brains; and (ii) can it block the cell-to-cell spread of tau seeds in vivo? First, antibody D effectively prevented the induction of tau pathology in the brains of transgenic mice that had been injected with human Alzheimer's disease brain extracts, showing that it could effectively neutralize the pathological species present in these extracts. Second, by using K18 P301L tau fibrils to induce pathology, we further demonstrated that antibody D was also capable of blocking the progression of tau pathology to distal brain regions. In contrast, an amino-terminal tau antibody, which was less effective at blocking tau seeding in vitro showed less efficacy in reducing Alzheimer's disease patient tau driven pathology in the transgenic mouse model. We did not address whether the same is true for a spectrum of other amino-terminal antibodies that were tested in vitro. These data highlight important differences between tau antibodies and, when taken together with other recently published data, suggest that epitope may be important for function.\", 'Central control malfunction in Wolfram syndrome: Report of one case of difficult weaning. Introduction: Wolfram syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness. A neurodegenerative syndrome is usually associated, including cerebellar ataxia. A few cases of central apnea have been reported in the literature. Here, we report a case of Wolfram syndrome with respiratory symptoms that led to the discovery of central apneas as well as complicated and delayed weaning in an intensive care unit (ICU). Observation: The patient is a 39-year-old woman diagnosed with Wolfram syndrome who was admitted to an ICU for septic shock. She experienced difficult weaning before central apneas were observed while spontaneous ventilation was being attempted. After two extubation failures, cerebral MRI was performed and revealed parenchymatous atrophy of the posterior brain fossa involving the cerebral trunk, cerebellar peduncles, as well as both cerebellum hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis. Even after the patient was tracheotomized, central apneas persisted when the patient breathed spontaneously with her tracheotomy, necessitating nocturnal ventilation. Conclusion: While central apneas Wolfram syndrome remain rare, they should be systematically investigated due to their association with severe morbimortality.', 'Brain MRI findings in severe COVID-19: A retrospective observational study. Background: Brain MRI parenchymal signal abnormalities have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Purpose: To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe COVID-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain MRI findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain MRI or brain MRI showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P < .05 represented a significant difference. Results: Thirty men (81%) and seven women (19%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years ± 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41%), confusion (12 of 37, 32%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19%). The most frequent MRI findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 59%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30%; 95% CI: 15%, 45%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24%; 95% CI: 10%, 38%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65%], P = .005). Only one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusion: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and without ischemic infarcts had a wide range of neurologic manifestations that were associated with abnormal brain MRI scans. Eight distinctive neuroradiologic patterns were described.', 'Molecular crosstalk between tumour and brain parenchyma instructs histopathological features in glioblastoma. The histopathological and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas represents a major obstacle for effective therapies. Glioblastomas do not develop autonomously, but evolve in a unique environment that adapts to the growing tumour mass and contributes to the malignancy of these neoplasms. Here, we show that patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts generated in the mouse brain from organotypic spheroids reproducibly give rise to three different histological phenotypes: (i) a highly invasive phenotype with an apparent normal brain vasculature, (ii) a highly angiogenic phenotype displaying microvascular proliferation and necrosis and (iii) an intermediate phenotype combining features of invasion and vessel abnormalities. These phenotypic differences were visible during early phases of tumour development suggesting an early instructive role of tumour cells on the brain parenchyma. Conversely, we found that tumour-instructed stromal cells differentially influenced tumour cell proliferation and migration in vitro, indicating a reciprocal crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. We did not detect any transdifferentiation of tumour cells into endothelial cells. Cell type-specific transcriptomic analysis of tumour and endothelial cells revealed a strong phenotype-specific molecular conversion between the two cell types, suggesting co-evolution of tumour and endothelial cells. Integrative bioinformatic analysis confirmed the reciprocal crosstalk between tumour and microenvironment and suggested a key role for TGFß1 and extracellular matrix proteins as major interaction modules that shape glioblastoma progression. These data provide novel insight into tumour-host interactions and identify novel stromaspecific targets that may play a role in combinatorial treatment strategies against glioblastoma.', 'The ideomotor recycling theory for tool use, language, and foresight. The present theoretical framework highlights a common action–perception mechanism for tool use, spoken language, and foresight capacity. On the one hand, it has been suggested that human language and the capacity to envision the future (i.e. foresight) have, from an evolutionary viewpoint, developed mutually along with the pressure of tool use. This co-evolution has afforded humans an evident survival advantage in the animal kingdom because language can help to refine the representation of future scenarios, which in turn can help to encourage or discourage engagement in appropriate and efficient behaviours. On the other hand, recent assumptions regarding the evolution of the brain have capitalized on the concept of “neuronal recycling”. In the domain of cognitive neuroscience, neuronal recycling means that during evolution, some neuronal areas and cognitive functions have been recycled to manage new environmental and social constraints. In the present article, we propose that the co-evolution of tool use, language, and foresight represents a suitable example of such functional recycling throughout a well-defined common action–perception mechanism, i.e. the ideomotor mechanism. This ideomotor account is discussed in light of different future ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives.', 'Diagnostic imaging tools to elucidate decreased cephalic biometry and fetal microcephaly: a systematic analysis of the central nervous system. ', 'The RDoC approach for translational psychiatry: Could a genetic disorder with psychiatric symptoms help fill the matrix? the example of Prader–Willi syndrome. The Research Domain Criteria project (RDoc) proposes a new classification system based on information from several fields in order to encourage translational perspectives. Nevertheless, integrating genetic markers into this classification has remained difficult because of the lack of powerful associations between targeted genes and RDoC domains. We hypothesized that genetic diseases with psychiatric manifestations would be good models for RDoC gene investigations and would thereby extend the translational approach to involve targeted gene pathways. To explore this possibility, we reviewed the current knowledge on Prader–Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by the absence of expression of some of the genes of the chromosome 15q11–13 region inherited from the father. Indeed, we found that the associations between genes of the PW locus and the modification identified in the relevant behavioral, physiological, and brain imaging studies followed the structure of the RDoC matrix and its six domains (positive valence, negative valence, social processing, cognitive systems, arousal/regulatory systems, and sensorimotor systems).', 'Selective neural synchrony suppression as a forward gatekeeper to piecemeal conscious perception. The emergence of conscious visual perception is assumed to ignite late (?250 ms) gamma-band oscillations shortly after an initial (?100 ms) forward sweep of neural sensory (nonconscious) information. However, this neural evidence is not utterly congruent with rich behavioral data which rather point to piecemeal (i.e., graded) perceptual processing. To address the unexplored neural mechanisms of piecemeal ignition of conscious perception, hierarchical script sensitivity of the putative visual word form area (VWFA) was exploited to signal null (i.e., sensory), partial (i.e., letter-level), and full (i.e., word-level) conscious perception. Two magnetoencephalography experiments were conducted in which healthy human participants viewed masked words (Experiment I: active task, Dutch words; Experiment II: passive task, Hebrewwords) while high-frequency (broadband gamma) brain activitywas measured. Findings revealed that piecemeal conscious perception did not ignite a linear piecemeal increase in oscillations. Instead, whereas late (?250 ms) gamma-band oscillations signaled full conscious perception (i.e., word-level), partial conscious perception (i.e., letter-level) was signaled via the inhibition of the early (?100 ms) forward sweep. This inhibition regulates the downstream broadcast to filter out irrelevant (i.e., masks) information. The findings thus highlight a local (VWFA) gatekeeping mechanism for conscious perception, operating by filtering out and in selective percepts.', 'Grey Matter changes in treatment-resistant depression during electroconvulsive therapy. Introduction:: 20–30% of depressed patients experience Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) remains the treatment of choice for TRD. However, the exact mechanism of ECT remains unclear. We aim to assess grey matter changes in patients with TRD undergoing bilateral ECT treatment at different points during and after treatment. Methods:: Patients are recruited at the University Hospital of Toulouse. Eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of TRD and an age between 50 and 70 years old. Patients received clinical assessments (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and structural scans (MRI) at three points: baseline (within 48 h before the first ECT); V2 (after the first ECT considered effective); and V3 (within 1 week of completing ECT). Results:: At baseline, controls had significantly higher cortical thickness than patients in the fusiform gyrus, the inferior, middle and superior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus and the transverse temporal gyrus (respectively: t(35)=2.7, p = 0.02; t(35)=2.89, p = 0.017; t(35)=3.1, p = 0.015; t(35)=3.6, p = 0.009; t(35)=2.37, p = 0.031; t(35)=2.46, p = 0.03). This difference was no longer significant after ECT. We showed an increase in cortical thickness in superior temporal gyrus between (i) baseline and V3 (t(62)=-3.43 p = 0.009) and (ii) V2 and V3 (t(62)=-3.42 p = 0.009). We showed an increase in hippocampal volume between (i) baseline and V3 (t(62)=-5.23 p < 0.001) and (ii) V2 and V3 (t(62)=-5.3 p < 0.001). Conclusion:: We highlight that there are grey matter changes during ECT treatment in a population with TRD compared to a healthy control population. These changes seem to occur after several rounds of ECT.', 'BACE1 inhibition more effectively suppresses initiation than progression of β-amyloid pathology. BACE1 is the rate-limiting protease in the production of synaptotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) species and hence one of the prime drug targets for potential therapy of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, so far pharmacological BACE1 inhibition failed to rescue the cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients, which indicates that treatment at the symptomatic stage might be too late. In the current study, chronic in vivo two-photon microscopy was performed in a transgenic AD model to monitor the impact of pharmacological BACE1 inhibition on early β-amyloid pathology. The longitudinal approach allowed to assess the kinetics of individual plaques and associated presynaptic pathology, before and throughout treatment. BACE1 inhibition could not halt but slow down progressive β-amyloid deposition and associated synaptic pathology. Notably, the data revealed that the initial process of plaque formation, rather than the subsequent phase of gradual plaque growth, is most sensitive to BACE1 inhibition. This finding of particular susceptibility of plaque formation has profound implications to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy for the prospective treatment of AD.', 'Greater male than female variability in regional brain structure across the lifespan. For many traits, males show greater variability than females, with possible implications for understanding sex differences in health and disease. Here, the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium presents the largest-ever mega-analysis of sex differences in variability of brain structure, based on international data spanning nine decades of life. Subcortical volumes, cortical surface area and cortical thickness were assessed in MRI data of 16,683 healthy individuals 1-90 years old (47% females). We observed significant patterns of greater male than female between-subject variance for all subcortical volumetric measures, all cortical surface area measures, and 60% of cortical thickness measures. This pattern was stable across the lifespan for 50% of the subcortical structures, 70% of the regional area measures, and nearly all regions for thickness. Our findings that these sex differences are present in childhood implicate early life genetic or gene-environment interaction mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of individual differences within the sexes, that may underpin sex-specific vulnerability to disorders.', 'Uncovering the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle and its topological organization in non-human primates: the missing connection for language evolution. Whether brain networks underlying the multimodal processing of language in humans are present in non-human primates is an unresolved question in primate evolution. Conceptual awareness in humans, which is the backbone of verbal and non-verbal semantic elaboration, involves intracerebral connectivity via the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF). While non-human primates can communicate through visual information channels, there has been no formal demonstration that they possess a functional homologue of the human IFOF. Therefore, we undertook a post-mortem diffusion MRI tractography study in conjunction with Klingler micro-dissection to search for IFOF fiber tracts in brain of Old-World (vervet) monkeys. We found clear and concordant evidence from both techniques for the existence of bilateral fiber tracts connecting the frontal and occipital lobes. These tracts closely resembled the human IFOF with respect to trajectory, topological organization, and cortical terminal fields. Moreover, these fibers are clearly distinct from other bundles previously described in this region of monkey brain, i.e., the inferior longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, and the external and extreme capsules. This demonstration of an IFOF in brain of a species that diverged from the human lineage some 22\\xa0millions years ago enhances our comprehension about the evolution of language and social behavior.', 'Frailty and Brain-Muscle Correlates in Older People With Type 2 Diabetes: A structural-MRI Explorative Study. Objectives: Muscle alterations, mainly functional alterations are frequently observed in older people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Sarcopenia may be one mechanism of transition to frailty in these people. Thus, we aim to explore the characteristics of muscle and its association with cerebral grey matter volumes within this group. Methods: Single center study nested within the international MID-Frail (a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-modal intervention in older people with T2DM on frailty and quality of life) trial participants underwent both brain and muscle T1 MRI, nutritional and functional assessments. Muscle areas were measured in rectus femoris (RF). Relationships between MRI grey matter volumes and muscle areas or function tests were described using positive and negative regressions. Results: Twenty-six subjects (7 female, mean age 78.2 y, SD 5.0), 6 frail and 20 pre-frail were explored in this sub-study. Frail subjects had lower Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), hip flexor strength than pre-frail ones but similar BMI and balance. Total SPPB was positively related with hip flexor strength and maximal RF area. Balance SPPB sub-score was unrelated to strength or RF area. MNA score was correlated with hip flexor strength and to global grey matter but not to SPPB. Hip flexor strength was correlated with grey matter areas involved in motor control. Walking time was negatively and rising chair sub-score was positively associated with grey matter volumes of motor areas. Conclusions: Sarcopenia features were more frequent in frail than prefrail subjects and were associated with decrease in grey matter volumes involved in motor control.', 'Neural and functional correlates of impaired reading ability in schizophrenia. Deficits in early auditory processing (EAP) are a core component of schizophrenia (SZ) and contribute significantly to impaired overall function. Here, we evaluate the potential contributions of EAP-related impairments in reading to functional capacity and outcome, relative to effects of auditory social cognitive and general neurocognitive dysfunction. Participants included 30-SZ and 28-controls of similar age, sex, and educational achievement. EAP was assessed using an auditory working memory (tone-matching) task. Phonological processing and reading Fluency were assessed using the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing and Woodcock-Johnson reading batteries, respectively. Auditory-related social cognition was assessed using measures of emotion/sarcasm recognition. Functional capacity and outcome were assessed using the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment and Specific Level of Functioning scale, respectively. fMRI resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC) was used to evaluate potential underlying substrates. As predicted, SZ patients showed significant and interrelated deficits in both phonological processing (d = 0.74, p = 0.009) and reading fluency (d = 1.24, p < 0.00005). By contrast, single word reading (d = 0.35, p = 0.31) was intact. In SZ, deficits in EAP and phonological reading ability significantly predicted reduced functional capacity, but not functional outcome. By contrast, deficits in reading fluency significantly predicted impairments in both functional capacity and functional outcome. Moreover, deficits in reading fluency correlated with rsFC alterations among auditory thalamus, early auditory and auditory association regions. These findings indicate significant contributions of EAP deficits and functional connectivity changes in subcortical and early auditory regions to reductions in reading fluency, and of impaired reading ability to impaired functional outcome in SZ.', 'Common brain disorders are associated with heritable patterns of apparent aging of the brain. Common risk factors for psychiatric and other brain disorders are likely to converge on biological pathways influencing the development and maintenance of brain structure and function across life. Using structural MRI data from 45,615 individuals aged 3–96 years, we demonstrate distinct patterns of apparent brain aging in several brain disorders and reveal genetic pleiotropy between apparent brain aging in healthy individuals and common brain disorders.', 'Effect of Trans-Nasal Evaporative Intra-arrest Cooling on Functional Neurologic Outcome in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The PRINCESS Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Therapeutic hypothermia may increase survival with good neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Trans-nasal evaporative cooling is a method used to induce cooling, primarily of the brain, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ie, intra-arrest). Objective: To determine whether prehospital trans-nasal evaporative intra-arrest cooling improves survival with good neurologic outcome compared with cooling initiated after hospital arrival. Design, Setting, and Participants: The PRINCESS trial was an investigator-initiated, randomized, clinical, international multicenter study with blinded assessment of the outcome, performed by emergency medical services in 7 European countries from July 2010 to January 2018, with final follow-up on April 29, 2018. In total, 677 patients with bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were enrolled. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive trans-nasal evaporative intra-arrest cooling (n\\u2009=\\u2009343) or standard care (n\\u2009=\\u2009334). Patients admitted to the hospital in both groups received systemic therapeutic hypothermia at 32°C to 34°C for 24 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival with good neurologic outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2, at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were survival at 90 days and time to reach core body temperature less than 34°C. Results: Among the 677 randomized patients (median age, 65 years; 172 [25%] women), 671 completed the trial. Median time to core temperature less than 34°C was 105 minutes in the intervention group vs 182 minutes in the control group (P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). The number of patients with CPC 1-2 at 90 days was 56 of 337 (16.6%) in the intervention cooling group vs 45 of 334 (13.5%) in the control group (difference, 3.1% [95% CI, -2.3% to 8.5%]; relative risk [RR], 1.23 [95% CI, 0.86-1.72]; P\\u2009=\\u2009.25). In the intervention group, 60 of 337 patients (17.8%) were alive at 90 days vs 52 of 334 (15.6%) in the control group (difference, 2.2% [95% CI, -3.4% to 7.9%]; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.81-1.57]; P\\u2009=\\u2009.44). Minor nosebleed was the most common device-related adverse event, reported in 45 of 337 patients (13%) in the intervention group. The adverse event rate within 7 days was similar between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, trans-nasal evaporative intra-arrest cooling compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant improvement in survival with good neurologic outcome at 90 days. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01400373.', 'Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: MRI findings in HIV-infected patients are closer to rituximab- than natalizumab-associated PML. Objectives: To compare brain MRI findings in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated to rituximab and natalizumab treatments and HIV infection. Materials and methods: In this retrospective, multicentric study, we analyzed brain MRI exams from 72 patients diagnosed with definite PML: 32 after natalizumab treatment, 20 after rituximab treatment, and 20 HIV patients. We compared T2- or FLAIR-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, T2*-weighted images, and contrast enhancement features, as well as lesion distribution, especially gray matter involvement. Results: The three PML entities affect U-fibers associated with low signal intensities on T2*-weighted sequences. Natalizumab-associated PML showed a punctuate microcystic appearance in or in the vicinity of the main PML lesions, a potential involvement of the cortex, and contrast enhancement. HIV and rituximab-associated PML showed only mild contrast enhancement, punctuate appearance, and cortical involvement. The CD4/CD8 ratio showed a trend to be higher in the natalizumab group, possibly mirroring a more efficient immune response. Conclusion: Imaging features of rituximab-associated PML are different from those of natalizumab-associated PML and are closer to those observed in HIV-associated PML. Key Points: • Nowadays, PML is emerging as a complication of new effective therapies based on monoclonal antibodies. • Natalizumab-associated PML shows more inflammatory signs, a perivascular distribution “the milky way,” and more cortex involvement than rituximab- and HIV-associated PML. • MRI differences are probably related to higher levels of immunosuppression in HIV patients and those under rituximab therapy.', 'Relevance of follow-up in patients with core clinical criteria for alzheimer disease and normal csf biomarkers. Background: Few patients with a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile fulfill the clinical criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of misdiagnoses for these patients. Method: Patients from the e-PLM centers fulfilling the core clinical criteria for probable AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to AD (AD-MCI), with normal CSF Aβ1-42, T-tau and P-tau biomarkers and clinical follow-up, were included. Clinical and imaging data were reviewed by an independent board, from baseline (visit with clinical evaluation and CSF analysis) to the end of the follow-up, for a final diagnosis. Results: In the e-PLM cohort of 1098 AD patients with CSF analysis, 37 (3.3%) patients (20 with AD dementia core clinical criteria and 17 with AD-MCI core clinical criteria) had normal CSF biomarker profile and a clinical follow-up. All patients presented with episodic memory impairment and 27 (73%) had medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI-scan. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range 7-74), the final diagnosis was AD MCI or dementia for 9 (24%) patients, and unlikely due to AD for 28 (76%) patients. A misdiagnosis was corrected in 18 (49%) patients (mood disorders, non-AD degenerative dementia, vascular cognitive impairment, alcohol cognitive disorders, temporal epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis), and 10 (27%) patients had cognitive disorders of undetermined etiology. Conclusion: AD diagnosis (MCI or dementia) with normal CSF biomarkers is a rare condition. A clinical follow-up is particularly recommended to consider an alternative diagnosis.', 'Research Letter: Auto-activation deficit in schizophrenia: A case report. ', 'Risk factors for academic difficulties in children with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated acute demyelinating syndromes. Aim: To describe cognitive abilities through the evaluation of academic difficulties in children with acute demyelinating syndromes (ADS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. Method: This was an observational, retrospective study of a French paediatric cohort that included children aged 18 years and younger. Clinical, biological, and imaging data were collected and academic outcome was measured. Results: Seventy-six children were included in the study with a mean (SD) follow-up of 4 years 7 months (6y 4mo). Median age at disease onset was 9 years 1 months (interquartile range=4y 7mo–13y 11mo; 36 females, 40 males). Thirty-six children relapsed and 20 had academic difficulties at the last follow-up. Academic difficulties, as well as deep grey matter and putaminal lesions (p=0.047 and p=0.006 respectively), were significantly more prevalent in children aged 10 years and younger (p=0.02). Using univariate binary regression analysis, we found that age at disease onset of 10 years and younger (odds ratio [OR] 3.72 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.19–11.64]; p=0.024), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis at disease onset (OR 52.5 [95% CI 5.97–461.4]; p<0.001), and deep grey matter lesions (OR 17.33 [95% CI 3.87–77.72]; p<0.001) were associated with academic difficulties. Interpretation: MOG antibody-associated ADS have distinct clinical and radiological patterns that are age-dependent. Indirect cognitive evaluation through academic difficulties was prevalent in younger children and is associated with specific clinical and magnetic resonance imaging factors that need to be considered earlier on when assessing this patient population.', 'Wavelet p-Leader Non-Gaussian Multiscale Expansions for EEG series: An Exploratory Study on Cold-Pressor Test. Brain dynamics recorded through electroencephalography (EEG) have been proven to be the output of a nonstationary and nonlinear system. Thus, multifractality of EEG series has been exploited as a useful tool for a neurophysiological characterization in health and disease. However, the role of EEG multifractality under peripheral stress is unknown. In this study, we propose to make use of a novel tool, the recently defined non-Gaussian multiscale analysis, to investigate brain dynamics in the range of 4-8Hz following a cold-pressor test versus a resting state. The method builds on the wavelet p-leader multifractal spectrum to quantify different types of departure from Gaussian and linear properties, and is compared here to standard linear descriptive indices. Results suggest that the proposed non-Gaussian multiscale indices were able to detect expected changes over the somatosensory and premotor cortices, over regions different from those detected by linear analyses. They further indicate that preferred responses for the contralateral somatosensory cortex occur at scales 2.5s and 5s. These findings contribute to the characterization of the so-called central autonomic network, linking dynamical changes at a peripheral and a central nervous system levels.', 'Prediction of Multiple Sclerosis Patient Disability from Structural Connectivity using Convolutional Neural Networks. Prediction of disability progression in multiple sclerosis patients is a critical component of their management. In particular, one challenge is to identify and characterize a patient profile who may benefit of efficient treatments. However, it is not yet clear whether a particular relation exists between the brain structure and the disability status.This work aims at producing a fully automatic model for the expanded disability status score estimation, given the brain structural connectivity representation of a multiple sclerosis patient. The task is addressed by first extracting the connectivity graph, obtained by combining brain grey matter parcellation and tractography extracted from Diffusion and T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, and then processing it via a convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to compute the predicted score. Experiments show that the herein proposed approach achieves promising results, thus resulting as an important step forward on the road to better predict the evolution of the disease.', 'Tensor Based Blind Source Separation in Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis. Study of white matter (WM) fiber-bundles is a crucial challenge in the investigation of neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). In this activity, the amount of data to process is huge, and an automated approach to carry out this task is in order.In this paper we show how tensor-based blind source separation (BSS) techniques can be successfully applied to model complex anatomical brain structures. More in detail, we show how through vector hankelization it is possible to formalize data extracted from WM fiber-bundles using a tensor model. Two main tensor factorization techniques, namely (Lr, Lr, 1) block term decomposition (BTD) and canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), were applied to the generated tensor. The information extracted from the factorization was then used to differentiate between sets of fibers, within the bundle, affected by the pathology and normal appearing fibers.Performances of the proposed tensor-based model was evaluated on simulated data representing pathological effects of MS. Results show the capability of our tensor-based model to detect small pathological phenomena appearing along WM fibers.', 'Acute effects of meditation training on the waking and sleeping brain: Is it all about homeostasis?. Our recent finding of a meditation-related increase in low-frequency NREM sleep EEG oscillatory activities peaking in the theta-alpha range (4–12\\xa0Hz) was not predicted. From a consolidated body of research on sleep homeostasis, we would expect a change peaking in slow wave activity (1–4\\xa0Hz) following an intense meditation session. Here we compared these changes in sleep with the post-meditation changes in waking rest scalp power to further characterize their functional significance. High-density EEG recordings were acquired from 27 long-term meditators (LTM) on three separate days at baseline and following two 8-hr sessions of either mindfulness or compassion-and-loving-kindness meditation. Thirty-one meditation-naïve participants (MNP) were recorded at the same time points. As a common effect of meditation practice, we found increases in low and fast waking EEG oscillations for LTM only, peaking at eight and 15\\xa0Hz respectively, over prefrontal, and left centro-parietal electrodes. Paralleling our previous findings in sleep, there was no significant difference between meditation styles in LTM as well as no difference between matched sessions in MNP. Meditation-related changes in wakefulness and NREM sleep were correlated across space and frequency. A significant correlation was found in the EEG low frequencies (<12\\xa0Hz). Since the peak of coupling was observed in the theta-alpha oscillatory range, sleep homeostatic response to meditation practice is not sufficient to explain our findings. Another likely phenomenon into play is a reverberation of meditation-related processes during subsequent sleep. Future studies should ascertain the interplay between these processes in promoting the beneficial effects of meditation practice.', 'A Practical Approach to Cerebro-Somatic Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Whole-Body Ultrasound. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging noninvasive monitoring modality based on chromophore absorption of infrared light. Because NIRS provides instantaneous information on cerebral and somatic tissue oxygenation, it becomes mandatory to identify rapidly the etiology of impaired regional oxygenation and thus perfusion. To do so, the use of whole-body ultrasound (WHOBUS) represents a significant advance in the management of patients experiencing cerebral or somatic desaturation. This narrative review describes the authors’ experience since 2002 in the use of combined NIRS and WHOBUS. A practical approach in the use of both modalities and their respective limitations is described.', 'Contribution of fetal brain MRI in management of severe fetal anemia. Introduction: Intrauterine transfusion (IUT) has changed fetal anemia prognosis. However, long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is altered in 5% of children. Our objective was to study the contribution of fetal MRI to diagnosis brain lesions in case of fetal anemia. Material and Methods: Retrospective monocentric descriptive study from 2005 to 2016, including all patients followed for fetal anemia requiring IUT. The indications for MRI were: hydrops fetalis and / or hemoglobin <5 g / dL and / or more than 3 IUTs and / or acute severe anemia and / or ultrasound abnormality. Fetal and neonatal outcome and pediatric neurological monitoring were studied. Results: 89 patients were followed for fetal anemia with IUT and 28 (29.1%) had fetal MRI, 12 of which were abnormal. Two out of twelve had abnormal ultrasound. Seven out of twelve had poor neurological prognosis: 2 medical terminations of pregnancy were performed; 2 children had severe developmental delay and 3 children had schooling difficulties. Five out of twelve children had favorable neurological prognosis. Conclusion: MRI of the fetal brain makes it possible to better detect brain lesions than ultrasound does in the management of severe fetal anemia and seems particularly appropriate in cases of acute anemia.', 'The Brainarium: An Interactive Immersive Tool for Brain Education, Art, and Neurotherapy. Recent theoretical and technological advances in neuroimaging techniques now allow brain electrical activity to be recorded using affordable and user-friendly equipment for nonscientist end-users. An increasing number of educators and artists have begun using electroencephalogram (EEG) to control multimedia and live artistic contents. In this paper, we introduce a new concept based on brain computer interface (BCI) technologies: the Brainarium. The Brainarium is a new pedagogical and artistic tool, which can deliver and illustrate scientific knowledge, as well as a new framework for scientific exploration. The Brainarium consists of a portable planetarium device that is being used as brain metaphor. This is done by projecting multimedia content on the planetarium dome and displaying EEG data recorded from a subject in real time using Brain Machine Interface (BMI) technologies. The system has been demonstrated through several performances involving an interaction between the subject controlling the BMI, a musician, and the audience during series of exhibitions and workshops in schools. We report here feedback from 134 participants who filled questionnaires to rate their experiences. Our results show improved subjective learning compared to conventional methods, improved entertainment value, improved absorption into the material being presented, and little discomfort.', 'Are morphological and structural MRI characteristics related to specific cognitive impairments in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) children?. Introduction: NF1 children have cognitive disorders, especially in executive functions, visuospatial, and language domains, the pathophysiological mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Materials and methods: A correlation study was performed from neuropsychological assessments and brain MRIs of 38 NF1 patients and 42 controls, all right-handed, aged 8–12 years and matched in age and gender. The most discriminating neuropsychological tests were selected to assess their visuospatial, metaphonological and visuospatial working memory abilities. The MRI analyses focused on the presence and location of Unidentified Bright Objects (UBOs) (1), volume analysis (2) and diffusion analysis (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) (3) of the regions of interest including subcortical structures and posterior fossa, as well as shape analysis of subcortical structures (4). The level of attention, intelligence quotient, age and gender of the patients were taken into account in the statistical analysis. Then, we studied how diffusion and volumes parameters were associated with neuropsychological characteristics in NF1 children. Results: NF1 children present different brain imaging characteristics compared to the control such as (1) UBOs in 68%, (2) enlarged total intracranial volume, involving all subcortical structures, especially thalamus, (3) increased MD and decreased FA in thalamus, corpus callosum and hippocampus. These alterations are diffuse, without shape involvement. In NF1 group, brain microstructure is all the more altered that volumes are enlarged. However, we fail to find a link between these brain characteristics and neurocognitive scores. Conclusion: While NF1 patients have obvious pathological brain characteristics, the neuronal substrates of their cognitive deficits are still not fully understood, perhaps due to complex and multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder, as suggested by the heterogeneity observed in our study. However, our results are compatible with an interpretation of NF1 as a diffuse white matter disease.', 'Relationship of regional brain β-amyloid to gait speed. Objective: To investigate in vivo the relationship of regional brain β-amyloid (Aβ) to gait speed in a group of elderly individuals at high risk for dementia. Methods: Cross-sectional associations between brain Aβ as measured with [ 18 F]florbetapir PET and gait speed were examined in 128 elderly participants. Subjects ranged from healthy to mildly cognitively impaired enrolled in the control arm of the multidomain intervention in the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). Nearly all participants presented spontaneous memory complaints. Regional [ 18 F]florbetapir (AV45) standardized uptake volume ratios were obtained via semiautomated quantitative analysis using the cerebellum as reference region. Gait speed was measured by timing participants while they walked 4 meters. Associations were explored with linear regression, correcting for age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), and APOE genotype. Results: We found a significant association between Aβ in the posterior and anterior putamen, occipital cortex, precuneus, and anterior cingulate and slow gait speed (all corrected p < 0.05). A multivariate model emphasized the locations of the posterior putamen and the precuneus. Aβ burden explained up to 9% of the variance in gait speed, and significantly improved regression models already containing demographic variables, BMI, and APOE status. Conclusions: The present PET study confirms, in vivo, previous postmortem evidence showing an association between Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and gait speed, and provides additional evidence on potential regional effects of brain Aβ on motor function. More research is needed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these regional associations, which may involve motor and sensorimotor circuits hitherto largely neglected in the pathophysiology of AD.', 'Clinical subcategorization of minimally conscious state according to resting functional connectivity. Patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) have been subcategorized in MCS plus and MCS minus, based on command-following, intelligible verbalization or intentional communication. We here aimed to better characterize the functional neuroanatomy of MCS based on this clinical subcategorization by means of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting state fMRI was acquired in 292 MCS patients and a seed-based analysis was conducted on a convenience sample of 10 MCS plus patients, 9 MCS minus patients and 35 healthy subjects. We investigated the left and right frontoparietal networks (FPN), auditory network, default mode network (DMN), thalamocortical connectivity and DMN between-network anticorrelations. We also employed an analysis based on regions of interest (ROI) to examine interhemispheric connectivity and investigated intergroup differences in gray/white matter volume by means of voxel-based morphometry. We found a higher connectivity in MCS plus as compared to MCS minus in the left FPN, specifically between the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and left temporo-occipital fusiform cortex. No differences between patient groups were observed in the auditory network, right FPN, DMN, thalamocortical and interhemispheric connectivity, between-network anticorrelations and gray/white matter volume. Our preliminary group-level results suggest that the clinical subcategorization of MCS may involve functional connectivity differences in a language-related executive control network. MCS plus and minus patients are seemingly not differentiated by networks associated to auditory processing, perception of surroundings and internal awareness/self-mentation, nor by interhemispheric integration and structural brain damage.', 'Maternal protein restriction during gestation and lactation in the rat results in increased brain levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in their adult offspring. Early malnutrition is a risk factor for depression and schizophrenia. Since the offspring of malnourished dams exhibit increased brain levels of serotonin (5-HT), a tryptophan-derived neurotransmitter involved in the pathophysiology of these mental disorders, it is believed that the deleterious effects of early malnutrition on brain function are due in large part to altered serotoninergic neurotransmission resulting from impaired tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. However, tryptophan is also metabolized through the kynurenine (KYN) pathway yielding several neuroactive compounds including kynurenic (KA), quinolinic (QA) and xanthurenic (XA) acids. Nevertheless, the impact of perinatal malnutrition on brain kynurenine pathway metabolism has not been examined to date. Here, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous quantification of tryptophan and a set of seven compounds spanning its metabolism through the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, in the brain of embryos and adult offspring of rat dams fed a protein-restricted (PR) diet. Protein-restricted embryos showed reduced brain levels of Trp, serotonin and KA, but not of KYN, XA, or QA. In contrast, PR adult rats exhibited enhanced levels of Trp in the brainstem and cortex along with increased concentrations of 5-HT, kynurenine and XA. The levels of XA and KA were also increased in the hippocampus of adult PR rats. These results show that early protein deficiency induces selective and long-lasting changes in brain kynurenine metabolism. Given the regulatory role of KYN pathway metabolites on brain development and function, these changes might contribute to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders induced by early malnutrition. (Figure presented.).', 'Natural History of Adult Patients with GM2 Gangliosidosis. Objective: GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the HEXA (Tay–Sachs disease [TS]) or HEXB (Sandhoff disease [SD]) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. Methods: We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature. Results: We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users. Interpretation: Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:609–617.', 'On the mechanisms underlying Prism Adaptation: A review of neuro-imaging and neuro-stimulation studies. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioral task to assess visuo-motor plasticity and to ameliorate the symptoms of unilateral spatial neglect. Several studies have addressed the effects of PA on both sensory-motor and cognitive processing and the contribution of different brain regions to PA, although via non standardized procedures. The aim of the present review is to gather findings from the neuro-imaging and neuro-stimulation fields and put forward an interpretative framework for PA. The available evidence supports that sensory-motor effects of PA would mainly relate to the activation of a cerebello-parietal network, while the effects on spatial cognition would be mediated by bottom-up activation of temporal and prefrontal regions. The consolidation of PA effects would rely on activity of the motor cortex. The use of standardized PA procedures is strongly recommended for a systematic and accurate investigation of the neural mechanisms of PA.', 'Social brains and divides: The interplay between social dominance orientation and the neural sensitivity to hierarchical ranks. Ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, dominance hierarchies emerge through social competition and underlie the control of resources. Confronting the disruptive influence of socioeconomic inequalities, human populations tend to split into groups who legitimize existing dominance hierarchies and groups who condemn them. Here, we hypothesized that variations in the neural sensitivity to dominance ranks partly underpins this ideological split, as measured by the social dominance orientation scale (SDO). Following a competitive task used to induce dominance representations about three opponents (superior, equal and inferior), subjects were passively presented the faces of these opponents while undergoing fMRI. Analyses demonstrated that two key brain regions, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (aDLPFC) were sensitive to social ranks. Confirming our hypothesis, the sensitivity of the right aDLPFC to social ranks correlated positively with the SDO scale, which is known to predict behaviors and political attitudes associated with the legitimization of dominance hierarchies. This study opens new perspectives for the neurosciences of political orientation and social dominance.', 'Compressed-Sensing MP2RAGE sequence: Application to the detection of brain metastases in mice at 7T. Purpose: To develop a Compressed Sensing (CS)-MP2RAGE sequence to drastically shorten acquisition duration and then detect and measure the T1 of brain metastases in mice at 7\\xa0T. Methods: The encoding trajectory of the standard Cartesian MP2RAGE sequence has been modified (1) to obtain a variable density Poisson disk under-sampling distribution along the ky-kz plane, and (2) to sample the central part of the k-space exactly at TI1 and TI2 inversion times. In a prospective study, the accuracy of the T1 measurements was evaluated on phantoms containing increasing concentrations of gadolinium. The CS acceleration factors were increased to evaluate their influence on the contrast and T1 measurements of brain metastases in vivo. Finally, the 3D T1 maps were acquired with at 4-fold increased spatial resolution. The volumes and T1 values of the metastases were measured while using CS to reduce scan time. Results: The implementation of the CS-encoding trajectory did not affect the T1 measurements in vitro. Accelerating the acquisition by a factor of 2 did not alter the contrast or the T1 values of the brain metastases. 3D T1 maps could be obtained in\\xa0<\\xa01\\xa0min using a CS factor of 6. Increasing the spatial resolution enabled more accurately measurement of the metastasis volumes while maintaining an acquisition duration below 5\\xa0min. Conclusion: The CS-MP2RAGE sequence could be of great interest in oncology to either rapidly obtain mouse brain 3D T1 maps or to increase the spatial resolution with no penalty on the scan duration.', 'Exosome-associated AAV vector as a robust and convenient neuroscience tool. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are showing promise in gene therapy trials and have proven to be extremely efficient biological tools in basic neuroscience research. One major limitation to their widespread use in the neuroscience laboratory is the cost, labor, skill and time-intense purification process of AAV. We have recently shown that AAV can associate with exosomes (exo-AAV) when the vector is isolated from conditioned media of producer cells, and the exo-AAV is more resistant to neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies compared with standard AAV. Here, we demonstrate that simple pelleting of exo-AAV from media via ultracentrifugation results in high-titer vector preparations capable of efficient transduction of central nervous system (CNS) cells after systemic injection in mice. We observed that exo-AAV is more efficient at gene delivery to the brain at low vector doses relative to conventional AAV, even when derived from a serotype that does not normally efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Similar cell types were transduced by exo-AAV and conventionally purified vector. Importantly, no cellular toxicity was noted in exo-AAV-transduced cells. We demonstrated the utility and robustness of exo-AAV-mediated gene delivery by detecting direct GFP fluorescence after systemic injection, allowing three-dimensional reconstruction of transduced Purkinje cells in the cerebellum using ex vivo serial two-photon tomography. The ease of isolation combined with the high efficiency of transgene expression in the CNS, may enable the widespread use of exo-AAV as a neuroscience research tool. Furthermore, the ability of exo-AAV to evade neutralizing antibodies while still transducing CNS after peripheral delivery is clinically relevant.', 'Long-term impact of temozolomide on 1p/19q-codeleted low-grade glioma growth kinetics. Although upfront temozolomide (TMZ) has been widely-used to treat 1p/19q-codeleted diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG), its long-term impact on the growth kinetics of these tumors has not been determined. Based on serial magnetic resonance images we retrospectively evaluated the evolution of the mean tumor diameter (MTD) in 36 progressive 1p/19q-codeleted LGG treated with upfront TMZ. After TMZ onset, all but two patients (94.4%) presented a progressive MTD decrease that lasted for a median duration of 23\\xa0months (range 3–114). In 10 patients (27%) MTD regrowth occurred during TMZ treatment and in 22 patients (66%) after TMZ discontinuation. In these patients, median time to MTD regrowth after TMZ discontinuation was 12\\xa0months (range 1–88). The rate of MTD regrowth at 3 and 5\\xa0years after TMZ onset was 77 and 94%, respectively. Time to tumor progression (TTP) based on volumetric analysis was shorter than TTP based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) bidimensional criteria (23 vs. 35 months, p = 0.05) and shorter than time to next oncological treatment (23 vs. 46 months, p = 0.001). In 10 patients (27%), absence of volumetric analysis led to continue TMZ for a median of 10 cycles after MTD had started to regrow. Volumetric analysis is important to precisely assess chemotherapy efficacy in 1p/19q-codeleted LGG, identify early tumor progression and avoid futile chemotherapy continuation. In the present series, although some long-lasting volumetric responses were observed, most tumors resumed their growth within 3\\xa0years after TMZ onset.', \"Pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesia: Insights from multimodal imaging and immunohistochemistry in non-human primates. Background: Dopaminergic and serotonergic degenerations alter pharmacological neurotransmission and structural markers in Parkinson's disease (PD). Alteration of diffusion measures in key brain regions depict MPTP/MDMA lesions in the monkey model of PD. Whether dopatherapy impacts such diffusion measures remains an open question. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of L-DOPA treatment on diffusion alterations, PET imaging and immunohistochemical markers in MPTP/MDMA-intoxicated monkeys. Methods: We acquired PET imaging and measures of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy longitudinally and correlated them with behavior and post-mortem fiber quantification. Results: Severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia was correlated to serotonin transporter radioligand binding increases in the ventral striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex and decreases of mean diffusivity in the ventral striatum. After lesion of serotonergic fibers by MDMA and the second L-DOPA period, diffusion measures were no more altered while the serotonergic binding still increased in all regions of interest, despite abolition of dyskinesia. Interestingly, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the SERT radioligand binding was negatively correlated to the number of SERT fibers. Conclusion: These results show that the increase of SERT radioligand binding is not systematically paralleled by an increase of SERT fibers and does not always reflect the presence of LID. More specifically, our study suggest that SERT increase may be underpinned by an increased density of serotonergic fibers after MPTP and the first L-DOPA period, and by an elevation of SERT itself after MDMA and the second L-DOPA period. This highlights that DTI is complementary to PET imaging to decipher pathophysiological mechanisms underlying L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in a non-human primate model of PD.\", 'Toward neuroprosthetic real-time communication from in silico to biological neuronal network via patterned optogenetic stimulation. Restoration of the communication between brain circuitry is a crucial step in the recovery of brain damage induced by traumatic injuries or neurological insults. In this work we present a study of real-time unidirectional communication between a spiking neuronal network (SNN) implemented on digital platform and an in-vitro biological neuronal network (BNN), generating similar spontaneous patterns of activity both spatial and temporal. The communication between the networks was established using patterned optogenetic stimulation via a modified digital light projector (DLP) receiving real-time input dictated by the spiking neurons’ state. Each stimulation consisted of a binary image composed of 8 × 8 squares, representing the state of 64 excitatory neurons. The spontaneous and evoked activity of the biological neuronal network was recorded using a multi-electrode array in conjunction with calcium imaging. The image was projected in a sub-portion of the cultured network covered by a subset of the all electrodes. The unidirectional information transmission (SNN to BNN) is estimated using the similarity matrix of the input stimuli and output firing. Information transmission was studied in relation to the distribution of stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity, both regulated by the spontaneous dynamics of the SNN, and to the entrainment of the biological networks. We demonstrate that high information transfer from SNN to BNN is possible and identify a set of conditions under which such transfer can occur, namely when the spiking network synchronizations drive the biological synchronizations (entrainment) and in a linear regime response to the stimuli. This research provides further evidence of possible application of miniaturized SNN in future neuro-prosthetic devices for local replacement of injured micro-circuitries capable to communicate within larger brain networks.', 'Structural basis of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at tripartite synapses. Astrocytic Ca2+ signals can be fast and local, supporting the idea that astrocytes have the ability to regulate single synapses. However, the anatomical basis of such specific signaling remains unclear, owing to difficulties in resolving the spongiform domain of astrocytes where most tripartite synapses are located. Using 3D-STED microscopy in living organotypic brain slices, we imaged the spongiform domain of astrocytes and observed a reticular meshwork of nodes and shafts that often formed loop-like structures. These anatomical features were also observed in acute hippocampal slices and in barrel cortex in vivo. The majority of dendritic spines were contacted by nodes and their sizes were correlated. FRAP experiments and Ca2+ imaging showed that nodes were biochemical compartments and Ca2+ microdomains. Mapping astrocytic Ca2+ signals onto STED images of nodes and dendritic spines showed they were associated with individual synapses. Here, we report on the\\xa0nanoscale organization of astrocytes, identifying nodes as a functional astrocytic component of tripartite synapses that may enable synapse-specific communication between neurons and astrocytes.', 'A fast MR-thermometry method for quantitative assessment of temperature increase near an implanted wire. Purpose To propose a MR-thermometry method and associated data processing technique to predict the maximal RF-induced temperature increase near an implanted wire for any other MRI sequence. Methods A dynamic single shot echo planar imaging sequence was implemented that interleaves acquisition of several slices every second and an energy deposition module with adjustable parameters. Temperature images were processed in real time and compared to invasive fiber-optic measurements to assess accuracy of the method. The standard deviation of temperature was measured in gel and in vivo in the human brain of a volunteer. Temperature increases were measured for different RF exposure levels in a phantom containing an inserted wire and then a MR-conditional pacemaker lead. These calibration data set were fitted to a semi-empirical model allowing estimation of temperature increase of other acquisition sequences. Results The precision of the measurement obtained after filtering with a 1.6x1.6 mm2 in plane resolution was 0.2oC in gel, as well as in the human brain. A high correspondence was observed with invasive temperature measurements during RF-induced heating (0.5oC RMSE for a 11.5oC temperature increase). Temperature rises of 32.4oC and 6.5oC were reached at the tip of a wire and of a pacemaker lead, respectively. After successful fitting of temperature curves of the calibration data set, temperature rise predicted by the model was in good agreement (around 5% difference) with measured temperature by a fiber optic probe, for three other MRI sequences. Conclusion This method proposes a rapid and reliable quantification of the temperature rise near an implanted wire. Calibration data set and resulting fitting coefficients can be used to estimate temperature increase for any MRI sequence as function of its power and duration.', \"Temporal Metacognition as the Decoding of Self-Generated Brain Dynamics. Metacognition, the ability to know about one's thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15-40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network's trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.\", \"Encephalopathy induced by Alzheimer brain inoculation in a non-human primate. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive alterations, cerebral atrophy and neuropathological lesions including neuronal loss, accumulation of misfolded and aggregated β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and tau proteins. Iatrogenic induction of Aβ is suspected in patients exposed to pituitary-derived hormones, dural grafts, or surgical instruments, presumably contaminated with Aβ. Induction of Aβ and tau lesions has been demonstrated in transgenic mice after contamination with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates, with very limited functional consequences. Unlike rodents, primates naturally express Aβ or tau under normal conditions and attempts to transmit Alzheimer pathology to primates have been made for decades. However, none of earlier studies performed any detailed functional assessments. For the first time we demonstrate long term memory and learning impairments in a non-human primate (Microcebus murinus) following intracerebral injections with Alzheimer human brain extracts. Animals inoculated with Alzheimer brain homogenates displayed progressive cognitive impairments (clinical tests assessing cognitive and motor functions), modifications of neuronal activity (detected by electroencephalography), widespread and progressive cerebral atrophy (in vivo MRI assessing cerebral volume loss using automated voxel-based analysis), neuronal loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (post mortem stereology). They displayed parenchymal and vascular Aβ depositions and tau lesions for some of them, in regions close to the inoculation sites. Although these lesions were sparse, they were never detected in control animals. Tau-positive animals had the lowest performances in a memory task and displayed the greatest neuronal loss. Our study is timely and important as it is the first one to highlight neuronal and clinical dysfunction following inoculation of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates in a primate. Clinical signs in a chronic disease such as Alzheimer take a long time to be detectable. Documentation of clinical deterioration and/or dysfunction following intracerebral inoculations with Alzheimer human brain extracts could lead to important new insights about Alzheimer initiation processes.\", 'A molecular atlas of cell types and zonation in the brain vasculature. Cerebrovascular disease is the third most common cause of death in developed countries, but our understanding of the cells that compose the cerebral vasculature is limited. Here, using vascular single-cell transcriptomics, we provide molecular definitions for the principal types of blood vascular and vessel-Associated cells in the adult mouse brain. We uncover the transcriptional basis of the gradual phenotypic change (zonation) along the arteriovenous axis and reveal unexpected cell type differences: A seamless continuum for endothelial cells versus a punctuated continuum for mural cells. We also provide insight into pericyte organotypicity and define a population of perivascular fibroblast-like cells that are present on all vessel types except capillaries. Our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to decode the higher organizational principles of a tissue and may provide the initial chapter in a molecular encyclopaedia of the mammalian vasculature.', \"Stabilization of Human Tyrosine Hydroxylase in Maltodextrin Nanoparticles for Delivery to Neuronal Cells and Tissue. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a therapeutic approach envisioned decades ago for the correction of genetic disorders, but ERT has been less successful for the correction of disorders with neurological manifestations. In this work, we have tested the functionality of nanoparticles (NP) composed of maltodextrin with a lipid core to bind and stabilize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). This is a complex and unstable brain enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of dopamine and other catecholamine neurotransmitters. We have characterized these TH-loaded NPs to evaluate their potential for ERT in diseases associated with TH dysfunction. Our results show that TH can be loaded into the lipid core maltodextrin NPs with high efficiency, and both stability and activity are maintained through loading and are preserved during storage. Binding to NPs also favored the uptake of TH to neuronal cells, both in cell culture and in the brain. The internalized NP-bound TH was active as we measured an increase in intracellular L-Dopa synthesis following NP uptake. Our approach seems promising for the use of catalytically active NPs in ERT to treat neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by dopamine deficiency, notably Parkinson's disease.\", 'Neurobiological substrates of the positive formal thought disorder in schizophrenia revealed by seed connectome-based predictive modeling. Formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core symptom cluster of schizophrenia, but its neurobiological substrates remain poorly understood. Here we collected resting-state fMRI data from 276 subjects at seven sites and employed machine-learning to investigate the neurobiological correlates of FTD along positive and negative symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. Three a priori, meta-analytically defined FTD-related brain regions were used as seeds to generate whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) maps, which were then compared between schizophrenia patients and controls. A repeated cross-validation procedure was realized within the patient group to identify clusters whose rsFC patterns to the seeds were repeatedly observed as significantly associated with specific FTD dimensions. These repeatedly identified clusters (i.e., robust clusters) were functionally characterized and the rsFC patterns were used for predictive modeling to investigate predictive capacities for individual FTD dimensional-scores. Compared with controls, differential rsFC was found in patients in fronto-temporo-thalamic regions. Our cross-validation procedure revealed significant clusters only when assessing the seed-to-whole-brain rsFC patterns associated with positive-FTD. RsFC patterns of three fronto-temporal clusters, associated with higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., executive functions), specifically predicted individual positive-FTD scores (p = 0.005), but not other positive symptoms, and the PANSS general psychopathology subscale (p > 0.05). The prediction of positive-FTD was moreover generalized to an independent dataset (p = 0.013). Our study has identified neurobiological correlates of positive FTD in schizophrenia in a network associated with higher-order cognitive functions, suggesting a dysexecutive contribution to FTD in schizophrenia. We regard our findings as robust, as they allow a prediction of individual-level symptom severity.', \"Brain 5-HT1A Receptor Binding in Multiple System Atrophy: An [<sup>18</sup>F]-MPPF PET Study. Background: Loss of medullary serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) neurons has been linked to respiratory disturbances in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Broader 5-hydroxytryptamine dysfunction may contribute to additional motor/nonmotor symptoms in MSA. The objective of this study was to compare brain 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor binding between MSA and healthy controls. Secondary objectives were to compare 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor binding between MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD) and to assess potential associations with motor/nonmotor symptoms in MSA. Methods: 2′-Methoxyphenyl-(N-2′-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine positron emission tomography was performed in matched MSA patients (n = 16), PD patients (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 18). Results: 2′-Methoxyphenyl-(N-2′-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine distribution volume ratios were lower in MSA patients versus healthy controls in several brain regions including the caudate, raphe nuclei, thalamus, and brain stem. Distribution volume ratios were also lower in brain stem and amygdala in MSA versus PD. Moderate associations were found between 2′-methoxyphenyl-(N-2′-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine distribution volume ratios and fatigue, pain, and apathy in MSA. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate 5-hydroxytryptamine dysfunction in several brain regions in MSA, which may contribute to fatigue, pain, and apathy. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\", 'A Specific Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis of Type 2 Diabetic Mice Induces GLP-1 Resistance through an Enteric NO-Dependent and Gut-Brain Axis Mechanism. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies control glycemia in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. However, in some patients the treatment must be discontinued, defining a state of GLP-1 resistance. In animal models we identified a specific set of ileum\\xa0bacteria impairing the GLP-1-activated gut-brain axis for the control of insulin secretion and gastric emptying. Using prediction algorithms, we identified bacterial pathways related to amino acid metabolism\\xa0and transport system modules associated to GLP-1 resistance. The conventionalization of germ-free mice demonstrated their role in enteric neuron biology and the gut-brain-periphery axis. Altogether, insulin secretion and gastric emptying require functional GLP-1 receptor and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the enteric nervous system within a eubiotic gut microbiota environment. Our data open a novel route to improve GLP-1-based therapies.', 'Hybrid intracerebral probe with integrated bare LED chips for optogenetic studies. This article reports on the development, i.e., the design, fabrication, and validation of an implantable optical neural probes designed for in vivo experiments relying on optogenetics. The probes comprise an array of ten bare light-emitting diode (LED) chips emitting at a wavelength of 460 nm and integrated along a flexible polyimide-based substrate stiffened using a micromachined ladder-like silicon structure. The resulting mechanical stiffness of the slender, 250-μm-wide, 65-μm-thick, and 5- and 8-mm-long probe shank facilitates its implantation into neural tissue. The LEDs are encapsulated by a fluropolymer coating protecting the implant against the physiological conditions in the brain. The electrical interface to the external control unit is provided by 10-μm-thick, highly flexible polyimide cables making the probes suitable for both acute and chronic in vivo experiments. Optical and electrical properties of the probes are reported, as well as their in vivo validation in acute optogenetic studies in transgenic mice. The depth-dependent optical stimulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons is demonstrated by altering the brain activity in the cortex and the thalamus. Local network responses elicited by 20-ms-long light pulses of different optical power (20 μW and 1 mW), as well as local modulation of single unit neuronal activity to 1-s-long light pulses with low optical intensity (17 μW) are presented. The ability to modulate neural activity makes these devices suitable for a broad variety of optogenetic experiments.', 'Rare long-range cortical connections enhance human information processing. What are the key topological features of connectivity critically relevant for generating the dynamics underlying efficient cortical function? A candidate feature that has recently emerged is that the connectivity of the mammalian cortex follows an exponential distance rule, which includes a small proportion of long-range high-weight anatomical exceptions to this rule. Whole-brain modeling of large-scale human neuroimaging data in 1,003 participants offers the unique opportunity to create two models, with and without long-range exceptions, and explicitly study their functional consequences. We found that rare long-range exceptions are crucial for significantly improving information processing. Furthermore, modeling in a simplified ring architecture shows that this improvement is greatly enhanced by the turbulent regime found in empirical neuroimaging data. Overall, the results provide strong empirical evidence for the immense functional benefits of long-range exceptions combined with turbulence for information processing.', 'Brain fetal magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate maturation of normal white matter during the third trimester of pregnancy. Background: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve the estimation of fetal brain maturation and the interpretation of white matter signal intensity in pathological conditions. Objective: To investigate T2-based and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements for the evaluation of fetal brain maturation during the last trimester of pregnancy. Materials and methods: One hundred sixty-eight fetal brain MRIs were retrospectively analyzed (age range: 28–37 weeks of gestation) after ensuring that none of the children developed psychomotor or cognitive impairment (median follow-up: 4.7\\xa0years). Bilateral regions of interest were drawn on the frontal, occipital, parietal and temporal lobes from T2-W imaging and DWI, when available, to evaluate signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Ratios were calculated with two references (pons or thalamus and cerebrospinal fluid) to standardize signal intensities. Reproducibility was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Correlations with gestational age were evaluated with univariate and multivariate linear regressions. Results: T2 measurements were achieved in all cases, and DWI was available in 37 cases. Measurements and ratios were reproducible in eight localizations (i.e. intra- and interobserver ICCs >0.5): frontal T2/thalamus, parietal T2/thalamus, occipital T2/pons, parietal ADC/thalamus, occipital ADC/pons, temporal ADC/pons, occipital ADC and temporal ADC. The frontal T2/thalamus and parietal T2/thalamus correlated with gestational age (P<0.0001 and P=0.014, respectively). In the multivariate modeling, frontal T2/thalamus remained an independent predictor of the gestational age (P<0.0001). Conclusion: The frontal T2/thalamus ratio emerged as a potential additional biomarker of fetal brain maturation during the last trimester of pregnancy.', 'Are endocasts reliable proxies for brains? A 3D quantitative comparison of the extant human brain and endocast. Endocasts (i.e., replicas of the inner surface of the bony braincase) constitute a critical proxy for qualifying and quantifying variations in brain shape and organization in extinct taxa. In the absence of brain tissues preserved in the fossil record, endocasts provide the only direct evidence of brain evolution. However, debates on whether or not information inferred from the study of endocasts reflects brain shape and organization have polarized discussions in paleoneurology since the earliest descriptions of cerebral imprints in fossil hominin crania. By means of imaging techniques (i.e., MRIs and CT scans) and 3D modelling methods (i.e., surface-based comparisons), we collected consistent morphological (i.e., shape) and structural (i.e., sulci) information on the variation patterns between the brain and the endocast based on a sample of extant human individuals (N\\xa0=\\xa05) from the 3D clinical image database of the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria (South Africa) and the Hôpitaux Universitaires Pitié Salpêtrière in Paris (France). Surfaces of the brain and endocast of the same individual were segmented from the 3D MRIs and CT images, respectively. Sulcal imprints were automatically detected. We performed a deformation-based shape analysis to compare both the shape and the sulcal pattern of the brain and the endocast. We demonstrated that there is close correspondence in terms of morphology and organization between the brain and the corresponding endocast with the exception of the superior region. By comparatively quantifying the shape and organization of the brain and endocast, this work represents an important reference for paleoneurological studies.', 'In vivo efficacy of measles virus fusion protein-derived peptides is modulated by the properties of self-assembly and membrane residence. Measles virus (MV) infection is undergoing resurgence and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide despite the availability of an effective measles vaccine. MV infects its target cells by coordinated action of the MV hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins; upon receptor engagement by H, the prefusion F undergoes a structural transition, extending and inserting into the target cell membrane and then refolding into a postfusion structure that fuses the viral and cell membranes. By interfering with this structural transition of F, peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR) regions of F can inhibit MV infection at the entry stage. In previous work, we have generated potent MV fusion inhibitors by dimerizing the F-derived peptides and conjugating them to cholesterol. We have shown that prophylactic intranasal administration of our lead fusion inhibitor efficiently protects from MV infection in vivo. We show here that peptides tagged with lipophilic moieties self-assemble into nanoparticles until they reach the target cells, where they are integrated into cell membranes. The selfassembly feature enhances biodistribution and the half-life of the peptides, while integration into the target cell membrane increases fusion inhibitor potency. These factors together modulate in vivo efficacy. The results suggest a new framework for developing effective fusion inhibitory peptides.', 'Brain anatomy of the 4-day-old European rabbit. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a widely used model in fundamental, medical and veterinary neurosciences. Besides investigations in adults, rabbit pups are relevant to study perinatal neurodevelopment and early behaviour. To date, the rabbit is also the only species in which a pheromone – the mammary pheromone (MP) – emitted by lactating females and active on neonatal adaptation has been described. The MP is crucial since it contributes directly to nipple localisation and oral seizing in neonates, i.e. to their sucking success. It may also be one of the non-photic cues arising from the mother, which stimulates synchronisation of the circadian system during pre-visual developmental stages. Finally, the MP promotes neonatal odour associative and appetitive conditioning in a remarkably rapid and efficient way. For these different reasons, the rabbit offers a currently unique opportunity to determine pheromonal-induced brain processing supporting adaptation early in life. Therefore, it is of interest to create a reference work of the newborn rabbit pup brain, which may constitute a tool for future multi-disciplinary and multi-approach research in this model, and allow comparisons related to the neuroethological basis of social and feeding behaviour among newborns of various species. Here, in line with existing experimental studies, and based on original observations, we propose a functional anatomical description of brain sections in 4-day-old rabbits with a particular focus on seven brain regions which appear important for neonatal perception of sensory signals emitted by the mother, circadian adaptation to the short and single daily nursing of the mother in the nest, and expression of specific motor actions involved in nipple localisation and milk intake. These brain regions involve olfactory circuits, limbic-related areas important in reward, motivation, learning and memory formation, homeostatic areas engaged in food anticipation, and regions implicated in circadian rhythm and arousal, as well as in motricity.', 'MRI white matter lesion segmentation using an ensemble of neural networks and overcomplete patch-based voting. Accurate quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for the analysis of normal brain ageing or neurodegeneration. Reliable automatic extraction of WMH lesions is challenging due to their heterogeneous spatial occurrence, their small size and their diffuse nature. In this paper, we present an automatic method to segment these lesions based on an ensemble of overcomplete patch-based neural networks. The proposed method successfully provides accurate and regular segmentations due to its overcomplete nature while minimizing the segmentation error by using a boosted ensemble of neural networks. The proposed method compared favourably to state of the art techniques using two different neurodegenerative datasets.', 'Sub-chronic inhalation of lead oxide nanoparticles revealed their broad distribution and tissue-specific subcellular localization in target organs. Background: Lead is well known environmental pollutant, which can cause toxic effects in multiple organ systems. However, the influence of lead oxide nanoparticles, frequently emitted to the environment by high temperature technological processes, is still concealed. Therefore, we investigate lead oxide nanoparticle distribution through the body upon their entry into lungs and determine the microscopic and ultramicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in primary and secondary target organs. Methods: Adult female mice (ICR strain) were continuously exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO-NPs) with an average concentration approximately 106 particles/cm3 for 6 weeks (24 h/day, 7 days/week). At the end of the exposure period, lung, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, and blood were collected for chemical, histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. Results: Lead content was found to be the highest in the kidney and lungs, followed by the liver and spleen; the smallest content of lead was found in brain. Nanoparticles were located in all analysed tissues and their highest number was found in the lung and liver. Kidney, spleen and brain contained lower number of nanoparticles, being about the same in all three organs. Lungs of animals exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles exhibited hyperaemia, small areas of atelectasis, alveolar emphysema, focal acute catarrhal bronchiolitis and also haemostasis with presence of siderophages in some animals. Nanoparticles were located in phagosomes or formed clusters within cytoplasmic vesicles. In the liver, lead oxide nanoparticle exposure caused hepatic remodeling with enlargement and hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes, centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes with karyomegaly, areas of hepatic necrosis, occasional periportal inflammation, and extensive accumulation of lipid droplets. Nanoparticles were accumulated within mitochondria and peroxisomes forming aggregates enveloped by an electron-dense mitochondrial matrix. Only in some kidney samples, we observed areas of inflammatory infiltrates around renal corpuscles, tubules or vessels in the cortex. Lead oxide nanoparticles were dispersed in the cytoplasm, but not within cell organelles. There were no significant morphological changes in the spleen as a secondary target organ. Thus, pathological changes correlated with the amount of nanoparticles found in cells rather than with the concentration of lead in a given organ. Conclusions: Sub-chronic exposure to lead oxide nanoparticles has profound negative effects at both cellular and tissue levels. Notably, the fate and arrangement of lead oxide nanoparticles were dependent on the type of organs.', 'Electroencephalographic characteristics of epileptic seizures in preterm neonates. Objective: Although seizures are more common in the neonatal period than in any other stage of childhood, those in preterm neonates are still poorly described. The aim of this study was to assess electro-clinical characteristics of seizures occurring before a corrected age of 40 weeks in neonates born prematurely. Method: Retrospective analysis of EEG-documented seizures in neonates born prematurely. Seizures in a group of term neonates served as controls. Results: Fifty-six prematurely born and 46 term born neonates were included. Median duration of seizures was 52 s in preterm and 96 s in term neonates. Seizures were focal or multifocal. In least mature neonates, they involved smaller regions of onset and remained localised. With increasing corrected age, propagation became more frequent. The electrographic pattern - maximal frequency of oscillation and the onset pattern also evolved with age. Electro-clinical seizures were observed in 25% of preterm versus 50% of term neonates; almost all electro-clinical seizures involved the central (motor) regions. Conclusion: Ictal EEG features undergo changes depending on corrected age. Most seizures are subclinical, thus EEG is essential for diagnosis. Significance: Relating ictal EEG pattern to corrected age can improve diagnosis and ultimately management.', 'A brainwide atlas of synapses across the mouse life span. Synapses connect neurons together to form the circuits of the brain, and their molecular composition controls innate and learned behavior. We analyzed the molecular and morphological diversity of 5 billion excitatory synapses at single-synapse resolution across the mouse brain from birth to old age. A continuum of changes alters synapse composition in all brain regions across the life span. Expansion in synapse diversity produces differentiation of brain regions until early adulthood, and compositional changes cause dedifferentiation in old age. The spatiotemporal synaptome architecture of the brain potentially accounts for life-span transitions in intellectual ability, memory, and susceptibility to behavioral disorders.', 'Towards HCP-Style macaque connectomes: 24-Channel 3T multi-array coil, MRI sequences and preprocessing. Macaque monkeys are an important animal model where invasive investigations can lead to a better understanding of the cortical organization of primates including humans. However, the tools and methods for noninvasive image acquisition (e.g. MRI RF coils and pulse sequence protocols) and image data preprocessing have lagged behind those developed for humans. To resolve the structural and functional characteristics of the smaller macaque brain, high spatial, temporal, and angular resolutions combined with high signal-to-noise ratio are required to ensure good image quality. To address these challenges, we developed a macaque 24-channel receive coil for 3-T MRI with parallel imaging capabilities. This coil enables adaptation of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) image acquisition protocols to the in-vivo macaque brain. In addition, we adapted HCP preprocessing methods to the macaque brain, including spatial minimal preprocessing of structural, functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion MRI (dMRI). The coil provides the necessary high signal-to-noise ratio and high efficiency in data acquisition, allowing four- and five-fold accelerations for dMRI and fMRI. Automated FreeSurfer segmentation of cortex, reconstruction of cortical surface, removal of artefacts and nuisance signals in fMRI, and distortion correction of dMRI all performed well, and the overall quality of basic neurobiological measures was comparable with those for the HCP. Analyses of functional connectivity in fMRI revealed high sensitivity as compared with those from publicly shared datasets. Tractography-based connectivity estimates correlated with tracer connectivity similarly to that achieved using ex-vivo dMRI. The resulting HCP-style in vivo macaque MRI data show considerable promise for analyzing cortical architecture and functional and structural connectivity using advanced methods that have previously only been available in studies of the human brain.', 'Contactin-associated protein-like 2, a protein of the neurexin family involved in several human diseases. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) is a cell adhesion protein of the neurexin family. Proteins of this family have been shown to play a role in the development of the nervous system, in synaptic functions, and in neurological diseases. Over recent years, CASPR2 function has gained an increasing interest as demonstrated by the growing number of publications. Here, we gather published data to comprehensively review CASPR2 functions within the nervous system in relation to CASPR2-related diseases in humans. On the one hand, studies on Cntnap2 (coding for CASPR2) knockout mice revealed its role during development, especially, in setting-up the inhibitory network. Consistent with this result, mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene coding for CASPR2 in human have been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. On the other hand, CASPR2 was shown to play a role beyond development, in the localization of voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex that is composed of TAG-1, Kv1.1, and Kv1.2. This complex was found in several subcellular compartments essential for action potential propagation: the node of Ranvier, the axon initial segment, and the synapse. In line with a role of CASPR2 in the mature nervous system, neurological autoimmune diseases have been described in patients without neurodevelopmental disorders but with antibodies directed against CASPR2. These autoimmune diseases were of two types: central with memory disorders and temporal lobe seizures, or peripheral with muscular hyperactivity. Overall, we review the up-to-date knowledge on CASPR2 function and pinpoint confused or lacking information that will need further investigation.', 'Broadband time-resolved multi-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy system to monitor in vivo physiological changes of human brain activity. We have developed a broadband time-resolved multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy system that can monitor the physiological responses of the adult human brain. This system is composed of a supercontinuum laser for the source part and of an intensified charge-coupled device camera coupled with an imaging spectrometer for the detection part. It allows the detection of the spectral, from 600 to 900 nm, and spatial dimensions as well as the arrival time of photon information simultaneously. We describe the setup and its characterization in terms of temporal instrument response function, wavelength sensitivity, and stability. The ability of the system to detect the hemodynamic response is then demonstrated. First, an in vivo experiment on an adult volunteer was performed to monitor the response in the arm during a cuff occlusion. Second, the response in the brain during a cognitive task was monitored on a group of five healthy volunteers. Moreover, looking at the response at different time windows, we could monitor the hemodynamic response in depth, enhancing the detection of the cortical activation. Those first results demonstrate the ability of our system to discriminate between the responses of superficial and deep tissues, addressing an important issue in functional near-infrared spectroscopy.', 'Neurofeedback for cognitive enhancement and intervention and brain plasticity. In recent years, neurofeedback has been used as a cognitive training tool to improve brain functions for clinical or recreational purposes. It is based on providing participants with feedback about their brain activity and training them to control it, initiating directional changes. The overarching hypothesis behind this method is that this control results in an enhancement of the cognitive abilities associated with this brain activity, and triggers specific structural and functional changes in the brain, promoted by learning and neuronal plasticity effects. Here, we review the general methodological principles behind neurofeedback and we describe its behavioural benefits in clinical and experimental contexts. We review the non-specific effects of neurofeedback on the reinforcement learning striato-frontal networks as well as the more specific changes in the cortical networks on which the neurofeedback control is exerted. Last, we analyse the current challenges faces by neurofeedback studies, including the quantification of the temporal dynamics of neurofeedback effects, the generalisation of its behavioural outcomes to everyday life situations, the design of appropriate controls to disambiguate placebo from true neurofeedback effects and the development of more advanced cortical signal processing to achieve a finer-grained real-time modelling of cognitive functions.', 'Cooperative defence operates by social modulation of biogenic amine levels in the honey bee brain. The defence of a society often requires that some specialized members coordinate to repel a threat at personal risk. This is especially true for honey bee guards, which defend the hive and may sacrifice their lives upon stinging. Central to this cooperative defensive response is the sting alarm pheromone, which has isoamyl acetate (IAA) as its main component. Although this defensive behaviour has been well described, the neural mechanisms triggered by IAA to coordinate stinging have long remained unknown. Here we show that IAA upregulates brain levels of serotonin and dopamine, thereby increasing the likelihood of an individual bee to attack and sting. Pharmacological enhancement of the levels of both amines induces higher defensive responsiveness, while decreasing them via antagonists decreases stinging. Our results thus uncover the neural mechanism by which an alarm pheromone recruits individuals to attack and repel a threat, and suggest that the alarm pheromone of honey bees acts on their response threshold rather than as a direct trigger.', 'Dynamic Changes in White Matter Abnormalities Correlate with Late Improvement and Deterioration Following TBI: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study. Objective. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not a single insult with monophasic resolution, but a chronic disease, with dynamic processes that remain active for years. We aimed to assess patient trajectories over the entire disease narrative, from ictus to late outcome. Methods. Twelve patients with moderate-to-severe TBI underwent magnetic resonance imaging in the acute phase (within 1 week of injury) and twice in the chronic phase of injury (median 7 and 21 months), with some undergoing imaging at up to 2 additional time points. Longitudinal imaging changes were assessed using structural volumetry, deterministic tractography, voxel-based diffusion tensor analysis, and region of interest analyses (including corpus callosum, parasagittal white matter, and thalamus). Imaging changes were related to behavior. Results. Changes in structural volumes, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity continued for months to years postictus. Changes in diffusion tensor imaging were driven by increases in both axial and radial diffusivity except for the earliest time point, and were associated with changes in reaction time and performance in a visual memory and learning task (paired associates learning). Dynamic structural changes after TBI can be detected using diffusion tensor imaging and could explain changes in behavior. Conclusions. These data can provide further insight into early and late pathophysiology, and begin to provide a framework that allows magnetic resonance imaging to be used as an imaging biomarker of therapy response. Knowledge of the temporal pattern of changes in TBI patient populations also provides a contextual framework for assessing imaging changes in individuals at any given time point.', 'Activation of adenosine A3 receptor reduces early brain injury by alleviating neuroinflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in elderly rats. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and hazard ratio of death increase with age. Overactivation of microglia contributes to brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the effects of A3 adenosine receptors (A3R) activation on neurofunction and microglial phenotype polarization in the context of SAH in aged rats. The A3R agonist (CI-IB-MECA) and antagonist (MRS1523) were used in the SAH model. Microglia were cultured to mimic SAH in the presence or absence of CI-IB-MECA and/or siRNA for A3R. The neurofunction and status of the microglial phenotype were evaluated. The P38 inhibitor SB202190 and the STAT6 inhibitor AS 1517499 were used to explore the signaling pathway. The results showed that SAH induced microglia to polarize to the M(LPS) phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. CI-IB-MECA distinctly skewed microglia towards the M(IL-4) phenotype and ameliorated neurological dysfunction, along with the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Knockdown of A3R or inhibition of P38 and/or STAT6 weakened the effects of CI-IB-MECA on microglial phenotypic shifting. Collectively, our findings suggest that activation of A3R exerted anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects by regulating microglial phenotype polarization through P38/STAT6 pathway and indicated that A3R agonists may be a promising therapeutic options for the treatment of brain injury after SAH.', 'Psychological aspects of awake brain surgery in children—interests and risks. Awake brain surgery (ABS) in children remains a subject of controversial debate for the potential psychological limitations that are related to this type of procedure. However, the tolerance and benefits of ABS in adults advocate for increased application of ABS in children. In this study, we report the psychological assessment, evaluation algorithm, and outcome of pediatric patients, who underwent ABS for surgical treatment of lesions in eloquent areas. Psychological selection criteria and the specifications of psychological support are described. A retrospective review and analysis of psychological assessment and psychological outcome of pediatric patients, who underwent ABS between 2005 and 2018 at the Department of pediatric neurosurgery, University of Lyon, France, was performed. Long-term psychological outcomes are reported. ABS was proposed to 18 children aged between 9 and 17\\xa0years and their families. After psychological evaluation of the individual patient and their familial surrounding, five boys and 12 girls (n = 17) were accounted eligible for ABS. They underwent asleep-awake-asleep brain surgery with intraoperative testing. In 16 cases, ABS could be performed as planned. Psychological alterations were postoperatively observed in 3 patients, symptoms of a post-traumatic stress disorder in 1 patient. The precise preoperative evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio in children plays a crucial role in anticipating a good psychological outcome. Professional psychological preparation and support of the child and his or her family are the key elements for successful completion of ABS.', \"Maternal physical activity-induced adaptive transcriptional response in brain and placenta of mothers and rat offspring. Maternal physical activity induces brain functional changes and neuroplasticity, leading to an improvement of cognitive functions, such as learning and memory in the offspring. This study investigated the effects of voluntary maternal physical activity on the gene expression of the neurotrophic factors (NTFs): BDNF, NTF4, NTRK2, IGF-1 and IGF-1r in the different areas of mother's brain, placenta and foetus brain of rats. Female Wistar rats (n = 15) were individually housed in voluntary physical activity cages, containing a running wheel, for 4 weeks (period of adaptation) before gestation. Rats were classified as inactive (I, n = 6); active (A, n = 4) and very active (VA, n = 5) according to daily distance spontaneously travelled. During gestation, the dams continued to have access to the running wheel. At the 20th day of gestation, gene expression of NTFs was analysed in different areas of mother's brain (cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex), placenta and the offspring's brain. NTFs gene expression was evaluated using quantitative PCR. Very active mothers showed upregulation of IGF-1 mRNA in the cerebellum (36.8%) and NTF4 mRNA expression in the placenta (24.3%). In the cortex, there was a tendency of up-regulation of NTRK2 mRNA (p = 0.06) in the A and VA groups when compared to I group. There were no noticeable changes in the gene expression of NTFs in the offspring's brain. Our findings suggest the existence of a developmental plasticity induced by maternal physical activity in specific areas of the brain and placenta representing the first investment for offspring during development.\", 'Reactive astrocyte nomenclature, definitions, and future directions. Reactive astrocytes are astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling in response to injury, disease, or infection of the CNS. Although this remodeling was first described over a century ago, uncertainties and controversies remain regarding the contribution of reactive astrocytes to CNS diseases, repair, and aging. It is also unclear whether fixed categories of reactive astrocytes exist and, if so, how to identify them. We point out the shortcomings of binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad, neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional parameters—preferably in vivo—plus multivariate statistics and determination of impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models. These guidelines may spur the discovery of astrocyte-based biomarkers as well as astrocyte-targeting therapies that abrogate detrimental actions of reactive astrocytes, potentiate their neuro- and glioprotective actions, and restore or augment their homeostatic, modulatory, and defensive functions.', '<sup>123</sup>l-Iodobenzovesamicol SPECT imaging of cholinergic systems in dementia with lewy bodies. Cholinergic alterations in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are widely documented in post mortem studies whereas in vivo studies are sparse, particularly at subcortical level. We used 123l-iodobenzovesamicol, a single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) radiotracer of the Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter (VAChT), to evaluate in vivo in DLB the integrity of the three main cholinergic pathways: the Ch1 (septo-hippocampal), the Ch4 (innominato-cortical) and the Ch5 (ponto-thalamic) cholinergic pathways, as well as the striatal cholinergic interneurons. Secondarily, the involvement of the cholinergic system in cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders of DLB patients was assessed. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (age = 72±6.25 years) and 11 DLB patients (age = 76±10.50 years) underwent a dynamic 123l-iodobenzovesamicol SPECT scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MR images were automatically segmented, providing the volumes of several regions of interest (ROIs), including striatum and cholinergic terminals in CM (hippocampus), Ch4 (cortical lobes) and Ch5 (thalamus). For each ROI and each subject, a pharmacokinetic modeling led to the calculation of 123l-iodobenzovesamicol to VAChT nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) value. A neuropsychological evaluation of participants was performed, using the MMSE, Grober and Buchske, Isaac Set test, visual Discrimination and Wechsler tests. Cognitive fluctuations and apathy were assessed with the Walker and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory scales respectively. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, BPND values for DLB were significantly decreased In the Ch4 terminal regions of the anterior cingulate, superior and inferior parietal cortices (P=0.0006, 0.0015, and 0.0023 respectively), in the Ch5 projecting region of thalamus (P=0.0003) and in the striatum (P=0.0042). All of the neuropsychological test scores were significantly lower in DLB patients than in healthy subjects. Four DLB patients with apathy and 4 DLB patients without apathy were identified. In the anterior cingulate cortex, BPND values were significantly decreased in patients with apathy (p=0.004) and unchanged in patients without apathy compared to healthy subjects. Conclusion: Our results confirm the existence of cholinergic alterations in DLB, reaching both cortical and subcortical levels including the Ch5 pathway and the striatum. The alteration of the cholinergic transmission in the anterior cingulate cortex could be closely associated with the development of apathy.', 'Behavioral and fMRI responses to fearful faces are altered in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS). Objective: We hypothesized that children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) might have altered social cognitive skills and underlying neural networks. Methods: We studied 13 patients with BCECTS and 11 age-matched controls using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an emotional discrimination task consisting of viewing happy, fearful, scrambled, and neutral faces. Behavioral performance measured during the task was correlated with clinical variables and behavioral ratings. Results: In comparison with age-matched controls, children with BCECTS performing a fearful faces detection task showed significantly reduced bilateral fMRI activation in the insular cortex, caudate, and lentiform nuclei, as well as increased response time. The percentage of errors made by children with BCECTS correlated negatively with age, a finding not observed in controls. In patients, accuracy positively correlated with time since the last seizure. The above abnormalities were not observed during happy faces detection task, except for a slower response in children with BCECTS as compared to controls. Significance: Our study suggests that BCECTS is associated with altered social cognition network and function, particularly for the identification of fearful faces. The age dependency of some of these findings supports the view that a delayed maturation of spiking cortical regions might underlie the cognitive dysfunction observed in BCECTS.', 'Reducing behavioral dimensions to study brain-environment interactions. Movement vigor provides a window on action valuation. But what is vigor, and how to measure it in the first place? Strikingly, many different co-varying vigor-related metrics can be found in the literature. I believe this is because vigor, just like the neural circuits that determine it, is an integrated, low-dimensional parameter. As such, it can only be roughly estimated.', 'Drum training induces long-term plasticity in the cerebellum and connected cortical thickness. It is unclear to what extent cerebellar networks show long-term plasticity and accompanied changes in cortical structures. Using drumming as a demanding multimodal motor training, we compared cerebellar lobular volume and white matter microstructure, as well as cortical thickness of 15 healthy non-musicians before and after learning to drum, and 16 age matched novice control participants. After 8 weeks of group drumming instruction, 3 ×30 minutes per week, we observed the cerebellum significantly changing its grey (volume increase of left VIIIa, relative decrease of VIIIb and vermis Crus I volume) and white matter microstructure in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. These plastic cerebellar changes were complemented by changes in cortical thickness (increase in left paracentral, right precuneus and right but not left superior frontal thickness), suggesting an interplay of cerebellar learning with cortical structures enabled through cerebellar pathways.', 'Neurite density is reduced in the presymptomatic phase of C9orf72 disease. Objective To assess the added value of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) compared with conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and anatomical MRI to detect changes in presymptomatic carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutation. Methods The PREV-DEMALS (Predict to Prevent Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. Sixty-seven participants (38 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and 29 non-carriers (C9-)) were included in the present cross-sectional study. Each participant underwent one single-shell, multishell diffusion MRI and three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. Volumetric measures, DTI and NODDI metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Differences in white matter integrity, grey matter volume and free water fraction between C9+ and C9- individuals were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Results Compared with C9-, C9+ demonstrated white matter abnormalities in 10 tracts with neurite density index and only 5 tracts with DTI metrics. Effect size was significantly higher for the neurite density index than for DTI metrics in two tracts. No tract had a significantly higher effect size for DTI than for NODDI. For grey matter cortical analysis, free water fraction was increased in 13 regions in C9+, whereas 11 regions displayed volumetric atrophy. Conclusions NODDI provides higher sensitivity and greater tissue specificity compared with conventional DTI for identifying white matter abnormalities in the presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. Our results encourage the use of neurite density as a biomarker of the preclinical phase. Trial registration number NCT02590276.', \"Tau deletion reduces plaque-associated BACE1 accumulation and decelerates plaque formation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, BACE1 protease initiates the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) that eventually results in synthesis of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Aβ deposition in turn causes accumulation of BACE1 in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites, thereby potentiating progressive Aβ deposition once initiated. Since systemic pharmacological BACE inhibition causes adverse effects in humans, it is important to identify strategies that specifically normalize overt BACE1 activity around plaques. The microtubule-associated protein tau regulates axonal transport of proteins, and tau deletion rescues Aβ-induced transport deficits in\\xa0vitro. In the current study, long-term in\\xa0vivo two-photon microscopy and immunohistochemistry were performed in tau-deficient APPPS1 mice. Tau deletion reduced plaque-associated axonal pathology and BACE1 accumulation without affecting physiological BACE1 expression distant from plaques. Thereby, tau deletion effectively decelerated formation of new plaques and reduced plaque compactness. The data revealed that tau reinforces Aβ deposition, presumably by contributing to accumulation of BACE1 in plaque-associated dystrophies. Targeting tau-dependent mechanisms could become a suitable strategy to specifically reduce overt BACE1 activity around plaques, thereby avoiding adverse effects of systemic BACE inhibition.\", 'Poor cognitive ageing: Vulnerabilities, mechanisms and the impact of nutritional interventions. Background Ageing is a highly complex process marked by a temporal cascade of events, which promote alterations in the normal functioning of an individual organism. The triggers of normal brain ageing are not well understood, even less so the factors which initiate and steer the neuronal degeneration, which underpin disorders such as dementia. A wealth of data on how nutrients and diets may support cognitive function and preserve brain health are available, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological action in both normal ageing, age-related cognitive decline, and in the development of neurodegenerative disorders have not been clearly elucidated. Objectives This review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge of vulnerabilities that predispose towards dysfunctional brain ageing, highlight potential protective mechanisms, and discuss dietary interventions that may be used as therapies. A special focus of this paper is on the impact of nutrition on neuroprotection and the underlying molecular mechanisms, and this focus reflects the discussions held during the 2nd workshop ‘Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Functional Aspects and Mechanisms’ in Copenhagen in June 2016. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe). Conclusion Coupling studies of cognitive ageing with studies investigating the effect of nutrition and dietary interventions as strategies targeting specific mechanisms, such as neurogenesis, protein clearance, inflammation, and non-coding and microRNAs is of high value. Future research on the impact of nutrition on cognitive ageing will need to adopt a longitudinal approach and multimodal nutritional interventions will likely need to be imposed in early-life to observe significant impact in older age.', 'Combined MALDI mass spectrometry imaging and parafilm-assisted microdissection-based LC-MS/MS workflows in the study of the brain. Proteins and other biomolecules such as lipids are significant players in the central nervous system and are implicated in various neurological disorders. Their identification, quantification, and distribution are thus important not only in understanding the disease but also in developing treatments. A combined workflow allowing the localized microextraction of discrete regions identified by a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MSI) imaging experiment for proteomics analysis by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) is described in this chapter. MSI was initially used to map lipid distributions allowing for the identification of regions of interest (ROIs) that are then subjected to microextraction in a consecutive tissue section. Mounting of consecutive tissue on parafilm allows microdissection of the ROIs, where proteins can then be recovered for processing and LC MS/MS analysis. The PAM method provides a fast and cheap means to perform further downstream analysis after an MSI experiment.', \"Clinical and biomarker profiling of prodromal Alzheimer's disease in workpackage 5 of the Innovative Medicines Initiative PharmaCog project: A 'European ADNI study'. Background: In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the validation of biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and for use as a surrogate outcome in AD clinical trials is of considerable research interest. Objective: To characterize the clinical profile and genetic, neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers of prodromal AD in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients enrolled in the IMI WP5 PharmaCog (also referred to as the European ADNI study). Methods: A total of 147 aMCI patients were enrolled in 13 European memory clinics. Patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and lumbar puncture to assess the levels of amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ42), tau and p-tau, and blood samples were collected. Genetic (APOE), neuroimaging (3T morphometry and diffusion MRI) and EEG (with resting-state and auditory oddball event-related potential (AO-ERP) paradigm) biomarkers were evaluated. Results: Prodromal AD was found in 55 aMCI patients defined by low Aβ42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (Aβ positive). Compared to the aMCI group with high Aβ42 levels (Aβ negative), Aβ positive patients showed poorer visual (P = 0.001), spatial recognition (P < 0.0005) and working (P = 0.024) memory, as well as a higher frequency of APOE4 (P < 0.0005), lower hippocampal volume (P = 0.04), reduced thickness of the parietal cortex (P < 0.009) and structural connectivity of the corpus callosum (P < 0.05), higher amplitude of delta rhythms at rest (P = 0.03) and lower amplitude of posterior cingulate sources of AO-ERP (P = 0.03). Conclusion: These results suggest that, in aMCI patients, prodromal AD is characterized by a distinctive cognitive profile and genetic, neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers. Longitudinal assessment will help to identify the role of these biomarkers in AD progression.\", \"Neuroanatomical correlates of reality monitoring in patients with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations. Background. Reality-monitoring process enables to discriminate memories of internally generated information from memories of externally derived information. Studies have reported impaired reality-monitoring abilities in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations (AHs), specifically with an exacerbated externalization bias, as well as alterations in neural activity within frontotemporoparietal areas. In healthy subjects, impaired reality-monitoring abilities have been associated with reduction of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS). The current study aimed to identify neuroanatomical correlates of reality monitoring in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. Thirty-five patients with schizophrenia and AHs underwent a reality-monitoring task and a 3D anatomical MRI scan at 1.5 T. PCS lengths were measured separately for each hemisphere, and whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses were performed using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (version 12.6) to evaluate the gray-matter volume (GMV). Partial correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between reality-monitoring and neuroanatomical outcomes (PCS length and GMV), with age and intracranial volume as covariates. Results. The right PCS length was positively correlated with reality-monitoring accuracy (Spearman's ρ = 0.431, p = 0.012) and negatively with the externalization bias (Spearman's ρ = _0.379, p = 0.029). Reality-monitoring accuracy was positively correlated with GMV in the right angular gyrus, whereas externalization bias was negatively correlated with GMV in the left supramarginal gyrus/superior temporal gyrus, in the right lingual gyrus and in the bilateral inferior temporal/fusiform gyri (voxel-level p < 0.001 and cluster-level p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Conclusions. Reduced reality-monitoring abilities were significantly associated with shorter right PCS and reduced GMVin temporal and parietal regions of the reality-monitoring network in schizophrenia patients with AHs.\", 'European Reference Network for Rare Vascular Diseases (VASCERN) position statement on cerebral screening in adults and children with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic vascular dysplasia inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Approximately 10 % of patients have cerebral vascular malformations, a proportion being cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and fistulae that may lead to potentially devastating consequences in case of rupture. On the other hand, detection and treatment related-risks are not negligible, and immediate. While successful treatment can be undertaken in individual cases, current data do not support the treatment of unruptured AVMs, which also present a low risk of bleeding in HHT patients. Screening for these AVMs is therefore controversial. Structured discussions, distinctions of different cerebrovascular abnormalities commonly grouped into an \"AVM\"bracket, and clear guidance by neurosurgical and neurointerventional radiology colleagues enabled the European Reference Network for Rare Vascular Disorders (VASCERN-HHT) to develop the following agreed Position Statement on cerebral screening: 1) First, we emphasise that neurological symptoms suggestive of cerebral AVMs in HHT patients should be investigated as in general neurological and emergency care practice. Similarly, if an AVM is found accidentally, management approaches should rely on expert discussions on a case-by-case basis and individual risk-benefit evaluation of all therapeutic possibilities for a specific lesion. 2) The current evidence base does not favour the treatment of unruptured cerebral AVMs, and therefore cannot be used to support widespread screening of asymptomatic HHT patients. 3) Individual situations encompass a wide range of personal, cultural and clinical states. In order to enable informed patient choice, and avoid conflicting advice, particularly arising from non-neurovascular interpretations of the evidence base, we suggest that all HHT patients should have the opportunity to discuss knowingly brain screening issues with their healthcare provider. 4) Any screening discussions in asymptomatic individuals should be preceded by informed pre-test review of the latest evidence regarding preventative and therapeutic efficacies of any interventions. The possibility of harm due to detection of, or intervention on, a vascular malformation that would not have necessarily caused any consequence in later life should be stated explicitly. We consider this nuanced Position Statement provides a helpful, evidence-based framework for informed discussions between healthcare providers and patients in an emotionally charged area.', 'Favorable outcome of severe human herpes virus-6 encephalitis in an HIV-infected patient. ', 'A novel role for CAMKIIβ in the regulation of cortical neuron migration: implications for neurodevelopmental disorders. Perturbation of CaMKIIβ expression has been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, highlighting CaMKIIβ as a gene of interest. Yet, in contrast to CaMKIIα, the specific functions of CaMKIIβ in the brain remain poorly explored. Here, we reveal a novel function for this CaMKII isoform in vivo during neuronal development. By using in utero electroporation, we show that CaMKIIβ is an important regulator of radial migration of projection neurons during cerebral cortex development. Knockdown of CaMKIIβ causes accelerated migration of nascent pyramidal neurons, whereas overexpression of CaMKIIβ inhibits migration, demonstrating that precise regulation of CaMKIIβ expression is required for correct neuronal migration. More precisely, CaMKIIβ controls the multipolar–bipolar transition in the intermediate zone and locomotion in the cortical plate through its actin-binding and -bundling activities. In addition, our data indicate that a fine-tuned balance between CaMKIIβ and cofilin activities is necessary to ensure proper migration of cortical neurons. Thus, our findings define a novel isoform-specific function for CaMKIIβ, demonstrating that CaMKIIβ has a major biological function in the developing brain.', 'TDP-43 extracted from frontotemporal lobar degeneration subject brains displays distinct aggregate assemblies and neurotoxic effects reflecting disease progression rates. Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) is the main pathology in affected neurons of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Morphological diversity and neuroanatomical distribution of pTDP-43 accumulations allowed classification of FTLD cases into at least four subtypes, which are correlated with clinical presentations and genetic causes. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43. By combining SarkoSpin with mass spectrometry, we revealed proteins beyond TDP-43 that become abnormally insoluble in a disease subtype–specific manner. We show that pTDP-43 extracted from brain forms stable assemblies of distinct densities and morphologies that are associated with disease subtypes. Importantly, biochemically extracted pTDP-43 assemblies showed differential neurotoxicity and seeding that were correlated with disease duration of FTLD subjects. Our data are consistent with the notion that disease heterogeneity could originate from alternate pathological TDP-43 conformations, which are reminiscent of prion strains.', 'Brain structural investigation and hippocampal tractography in medication overuse headache: A native space analysis. Background: Spatial normalization of brain images, a prerequisite for voxel based morphometry analysis, may account for the large variability of the volumetric data in medication overuse headache (MOH); possibly because this disease concerns patients differing on both sex and age, and hence with different brain size and shape. Methods: The present study aimed at providing a subject-based analysis of macrostructure using a native space volumes segmentation (Freesurfer), and microstructure using a region of interest (ROI: i.e. hippocampus) tractography approach in MOH patients. Results: The results show that MOH patients had decreased volumes of left hemisphere temporal gyri (temporal superior, fusiform) and occipital middle gyrus, together with an increased volume of the left inferior (temporal) lateral ventricle. The left temporal volume was negatively correlated with depression score and medication dependence parameters. Seed-based tractography of the hippocampus revealed a decreased number of reconstructed fibers passing through the left hippocampus. Conclusion: To our knowledge, these alterations have not been described with methods involving brain normalization, and they indicate that left hemisphere temporal areas, including the hippocampus, may play a role in MOH pathophysiology. Trial registration number NCT00833209. Registered 29 January 2009', 'Large-scale plurimodal networks common to listening to, producing and reading word lists: an fMRI study combining task-induced activation and intrinsic connectivity in 144 right-handers. We aimed at identifying plurimodal large-scale networks for producing, listening to and reading word lists based on the combined analyses of task-induced activation and resting-state intrinsic connectivity in 144 healthy right-handers. In the first step, we identified the regions in each hemisphere showing joint activation and joint asymmetry during the three tasks. In the left hemisphere, 14 homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) located in the left Rolandic sulcus, precentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus, cuneus and inferior supramarginal gyrus (SMG) met this criterion, and 7 hROIs located in the right hemisphere were located in the preSMA, medial superior frontal gyrus, precuneus and superior temporal sulcus (STS). In a second step, we calculated the BOLD temporal correlations across these 21 hROIs at rest and conducted a hierarchical clustering analysis to unravel their network organization. Two networks were identified, including the WORD-LIST_CORE network that aggregated 14 motor, premotor and phonemic areas in the left hemisphere plus the right STS that corresponded to the posterior human voice area (pHVA). The present results revealed that word-list processing is based on left articulatory and storage areas supporting the action–perception cycle common not only to production and listening but also to reading. The inclusion of the right pHVA acting as a prosodic integrative area highlights the importance of prosody in the three modalities and reveals an intertwining across hemispheres between prosodic (pHVA) and phonemic (left SMG) processing. These results are consistent with the motor theory of speech postulating that articulatory gestures are the central motor units on which word perception, production, and reading develop and act together.', 'An improved neuroanatomical model of the default-mode network reconciles previous neuroimaging and neuropathological findings. The brain is constituted of multiple networks of functionally correlated brain areas, out of which the default-mode network (DMN) is the largest. Most existing research into the DMN has taken a corticocentric approach. Despite its resemblance with the unitary model of the limbic system, the contribution of subcortical structures to the DMN may be underappreciated. Here, we propose a more comprehensive neuroanatomical model of the DMN including subcortical structures such as the basal forebrain, cholinergic nuclei, anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. Additionally, tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging was employed to explore the structural connectivity, which revealed that the thalamus and basal forebrain are of central importance for the functioning of the DMN. The contribution of these neurochemically diverse brain nuclei reconciles previous neuroimaging with neuropathological findings in diseased brains and offers the potential for identifying a conserved homologue of the DMN in other mammalian species.', 'Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy Caused by a Homozygous Splicing Variant of SLC7A6OS. Exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A > G variant affecting a splice site in SLC7A6OS. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A > G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that biallelic loss-of-function variants in SLC7A6OS are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy.

Background: In vivo mapping by positron emission tomography of the serotonin 1A receptors has been hindered by the lack of suitable agonist positron emission tomography probes. 18F-labeled F13714 is a recently developed biased agonist positron emission tomography probe that preferentially targets subpopulations of serotonin 1A receptors in their \"active state,\" but its brain labeling pattern in nonhuman primate has not been described. In addition, a potential confound in the translatability of PET data between nonhuman animal and human arise from the use of anesthetics that may modify the binding profiles of target receptors. Methods: Positron emission tomography scans were conducted in a cohort of common marmosets (n = 4) using the serotonin 1A receptor biased agonist radiotracer, 18F-F13714, compared with a well-characterized 18F-labeled antagonist radiotracer, 18F-MPPF. Experiments on each animal were performed under both consciousness and isoflurane-anesthesia conditions. Results: 18F-F13714 binding distribution in marmosets by positron emission tomography differs markedly from that of the 18F-MPPF. Whereas 18F-MPPF showed highest binding in hippocampus and amygdala, 18F-F13714 showed highest labeling in other regions, including insular and cingulate cortex, thalamus, raphe, caudate nucleus, and putamen. The binding potential values of 18F-F13714 were about one-third of those observed with 18F-MPPF, with marked individual-and region-specific differences under isoflurane-anesthetized vs conscious conditions. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of investigating the brain imaging of serotonin 1A receptors using agonist probes such as 18F-F13714, which may preferentially target subpopulations of serotonin 1A receptors in specific brain regions of nonhuman primate as a biased agonist.', 'TRIP6 functions in brain ciliogenesis. TRIP6, a member of the ZYXIN-family of LIM domain proteins, is a focal adhesion component. Trip6 deletion in the mouse, reported here, reveals a function in the brain: ependymal and choroid plexus epithelial cells are carrying, unexpectedly, fewer and shorter cilia, are poorly differentiated, and the mice develop hydrocephalus. TRIP6 carries numerous protein interaction domains and its functions require homodimerization. Indeed, TRIP6 disruption in vitro (in a choroid plexus epithelial cell line), via RNAi or inhibition of its homodimerization, confirms its function in ciliogenesis. Using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate TRIP6 localization at the pericentriolar material and along the ciliary axoneme. The requirement for homodimerization which doubles its interaction sites, its punctate localization along the axoneme, and its co-localization with other cilia components suggest a scaffold/co-transporter function for TRIP6 in cilia. Thus, this work uncovers an essential role of a LIM-domain protein assembly factor in mammalian ciliogenesis.', 'Rapid production of new oligodendrocytes is required in the earliest stages of motor-skill learning. We identified mRNA encoding the ecto-enzyme Enpp6 as a marker of newly forming oligodendrocytes, and used Enpp6 in situ hybridization to track oligodendrocyte differentiation in adult mice as they learned a motor skill (running on a wheel with unevenly spaced rungs). Within just 2.5 h of exposure to the complex wheel, production of Enpp6-expressing immature oligodendrocytes was accelerated in subcortical white matter; within 4 h, it was accelerated in motor cortex. Conditional deletion of myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in oligodendrocyte precursors blocked formation of new Enpp6 + oligodendrocytes and impaired learning within the same ∼2-3 h time frame. This very early requirement for oligodendrocytes suggests a direct and active role in learning, closely linked to synaptic strengthening. Running performance of normal mice continued to improve over the following week accompanied by secondary waves of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation. We concluded that new oligodendrocytes contribute to both early and late stages of motor skill learning.', \"Association between Brain β-Amyloid and Frailty in Older Adults. Background: We sought to determine whether cortical and regional β-amyloid (Aβ) were cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with change in frailty status in older adults. Methods: We used data from 269 community-dwelling participants from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial (MAPT) who were assessed for brain Aβ using positron-emission tomography scan. Regional and cortical-to-cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios were obtained. Frailty was assessed by a frailty index composed of 19 items not directly linked to cognition and Alzheimer's disease. Results: A significant and positive cross-sectional and prospective relationship was found for Aβ in the anterior putamen (cross-sectional: β = 0.11 [0.02-0.20], p =. 02; prospective: β = 0.11 [0.03-0.19], p =. 007), posterior putamen (cross-sectional: β = 0.12 [0.009-0.23], p =. 03; prospective: β = 0.11 [0.02-0.21], p =. 02), and precuneus regions (cross-sectional: β = 0.07 [0.01-0.12], p =. 01; prospective: β = 0.07 [0.01-0.12], p =. 01) with increasing frailty. Conclusions: This study has found new information regarding cross-sectional and prospective positive associations between region-specific brain Aβ deposits and worsening frailty. The potential mechanisms involved require further investigation.\", 'Handedness and its genetic influences are associated with structural asymmetries of the cerebral cortex in 31,864 individuals. Roughly 10% of the human population is left-handed, and this rate is increased in some brain-related disorders. The neuroanatomical correlates of hand preference have remained equivocal. We resampled structural brain image data from 28,802 right-handers and 3,062 left-handers (UK Biobank population dataset) to a symmetrical surface template, and mapped asymmetries for each of 8,681 vertices across the cerebral cortex in each individual. Lefthanders compared to right-handers showed average differences of surface area asymmetry within the fusiform cortex, the anterior insula, the anterior middle cingulate cortex, and the precentral cortex. Meta-analyzed functional imaging data implicated these regions in executive functions and language. Polygenic disposition to left-handedness was associated with two of these regional asymmetries, and 18 loci previously linked with left-handedness by genome-wide screening showed associations with one or more of these asymmetries. Implicated genes included six encoding microtubule-related proteins: TUBB, TUBA1B, TUBB3, TUBB4A, MAP2, and NME7-mutations in the latter can cause left to right reversal of the visceral organs. There were also two cortical regions where average thickness asymmetry was altered in lefthandedness: On the postcentral gyrus and the inferior occipital cortex, functionally annotated with hand sensorimotor and visual roles. These cortical thickness asymmetries were not heritable. Heritable surface area asymmetries of language-related regions may link the etiologies of hand preference and language, whereas nonheritable asymmetries of sensorimotor cortex may manifest as consequences of hand preference.', 'Crossing Species Barriers Relies on Structurally Distinct Prion Assemblies and Their Complementation. Prion replication results from the autocatalytic templated assisted conversion of the host-encoded prion protein PrPC into misfolded, polydisperse PrPSc conformers. Structurally distinct PrPSc conformers can give rise to multiple prion strains. Within and between prion strains, the biological activity (replicative efficacy and specific infectivity) of PrPSc assemblies is size dependent and thus reflects an intrinsic structural heterogeneity. The contribution of such PrPSc heterogeneity across species prion adaptation, which is believed to be based on fit adjustment between PrPSc template(s) and host PrPC, has not been explored. To define the structural-to-fitness PrPSc landscape, we measured the relative capacity of size-fractionated PrPSc assemblies from different prion strains to cross mounting species barriers in transgenic mice expressing foreign PrPC. In the absence of a transmission barrier, the relative efficacy of the isolated PrPSc assemblies to induce the disease is like the efficacy observed in the homotypic context. However, in the presence of a transmission barrier, size fractionation overtly delays and even abrogates prion pathogenesis in both the brain and spleen tissues, independently of the infectivity load of the isolated assemblies. Altering by serial dilution PrPSc assembly content of non-fractionated inocula aberrantly reduces their specific infectivity, solely in the presence of a transmission barrier. This suggests that synergy between structurally distinct PrPSc assemblies in the inoculum is requested for crossing the species barrier. Our data support a mechanism whereby overcoming prion species barrier requires complementation between structurally distinct PrPSc assemblies. This work provides key insight into the “quasispecies” concept applied to prions, which would not necessarily rely on prion substrains as constituent but on structural PrPSc heterogeneity within prion population.', 'Current technical approaches to brain energy metabolism. Neuroscience is a technology-driven discipline and brain energy metabolism is no exception. Once satisfied with mapping metabolic pathways at organ level, we are now looking to learn what it is exactly that metabolic enzymes and transporters do and when, where do they reside, how are they regulated, and how do they relate to the specific functions of neurons, glial cells, and their subcellular domains and organelles, in different areas of the brain. Moreover, we aim to quantify the fluxes of metabolites within and between cells. Energy metabolism is not just a necessity for proper cell function and viability but plays specific roles in higher brain functions such as memory processing and behavior, whose mechanisms need to be understood at all hierarchical levels, from isolated proteins to whole subjects, in both health and disease. To this aim, the field takes advantage of diverse disciplines including anatomy, histology, physiology, biochemistry, bioenergetics, cellular biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, neurology, and mathematical modeling. This article presents a well-referenced synopsis of the technical side of brain energy metabolism research. Detail and jargon are avoided whenever possible and emphasis is given to comparative strengths, limitations, and weaknesses, information that is often not available in regular articles.', 'Does Parkinson’s disease start in the gut?. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions, termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, whose main component is alpha-synuclein. Based on the topographic distribution of Lewy bodies and neurites established after autopsy from PD patients, Braak and coworkers hypothesized that PD pathology may start in the gastrointestinal tract then spread through the vagus nerve to the brain. This hypothesis has been reinforced by the discovery that alpha-synuclein may be capable of spreading transcellularly, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for Braak’s hypothesis. This ‘gut to brain’ scenario has ignited heated debates within the movement disorders community and prompted a large number of studies in both humans and animals. Here, we review the arguments for and against the gut as the origin of PD. We conclude that the human autopsy evidence does not support the hypothesis and that it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions. We discuss how this issue might be further addressed in future research.', 'Test-retest reliability of the default mode network in a multi-centric fMRI study of healthy elderly: Effects of data-driven physiological noise correction techniques. Understanding how to reduce the influence of physiological noise in resting state fMRI data is important for the interpretation of functional brain connectivity. Limited data is currently available to assess the performance of physiological noise correction techniques, in particular when evaluating longitudinal changes in the default mode network (DMN) of healthy elderly participants. In this 3T harmonized multisite fMRI study, we investigated how different retrospective physiological noise correction (rPNC) methods influence the within-site test-retest reliability and the across-site reproducibility consistency of DMN-derived measurements across 13 MRI sites. Elderly participants were scanned twice at least a week apart (five participants per site). The rPNC methods were: none (NPC), Tissue-based regression, PESTICA and FSL-FIX. The DMN at the single subject level was robustly identified using ICA methods in all rPNC conditions. The methods significantly affected the mean z-scores and, albeit less markedly, the cluster-size in the DMN; in particular, FSL-FIX tended to increase the DMN z-scores compared to others. Within-site test-retest reliability was consistent across sites, with no differences across rPNC methods. The absolute percent errors were in the range of 5-11% for DMN z-scores and cluster-size reliability. DMN pattern overlap was in the range 60-65%. In particular, no rPNC method showed a significant reliability improvement relative to NPC. However, FSL-FIX and Tissue-based physiological correction methods showed both similar and significant improvements of reproducibility consistency across the consortium (ICC=0.67) for the DMN z-scores relative to NPC. Overall these findings support the use of rPNC methods like tissue-based or FSL-FIX to characterize multisite longitudinal changes of intrinsic functional connectivity. Hum Brain Mapp 37:2114-2132, 2016.', \"L-DOPA regulates α-synuclein accumulation in experimental parkinsonism. Aims: Widespread accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein aggregates is a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the pattern and extent of α-synuclein accumulation through PD brains is known, the impact of chronic dopamine-replacement therapy (the gold-standard pharmacological treatment of PD) on the fate of α-synuclein is still unknown. Here, we investigated the distribution and accumulation of α-synuclein in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) non-human primate model of PD and determined the effect of chronic L-DOPA treatment on MPTP-induced α-synuclein pathology. Methods: We measured the density of α-synuclein and tau immuno-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, putamen, hippocampal CA1 region, temporal cortex and dentate nucleus of control, MPTP and MPTP+L-DOPA-treated monkeys. Moreover, we also extracted and quantified Triton-X (TX) soluble and insoluble α-synuclein in putamen and hippocampus samples from a separate cohort of control, MPTP and MPTP+L-DOPA-treated monkeys. Results: MPTP-induced α-synuclein accumulation in NHP model of PD was not limited to the substantia nigra but also occurred in the putamen, hippocampal CA1 region and temporal cortex. Tau was increased only in the temporal cortex. Moreover, increased intraneuronal TX insoluble α-synuclein was truncated, but not in the structural form of Lewy bodies. The MPTP-induced increase in α-synuclein levels was abolished in animals having received L-DOPA in all the brain regions, except in the substantia nigra. Conclusions: Dopamine replacement therapy can dramatically ameliorate α-synuclein pathology in the MPTP NHP model of PD. Therefore, patient's dopaminergic medication should be systematically considered when assessing α-synuclein as a biomarker for diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and response to disease-modifying treatments.\", \"Regularity and Matching Pursuit feature extraction for the detection of epileptic seizures. Background: The neurological disorder known as epilepsy is characterized by involuntary recurrent seizures that diminish a patient's quality of life. Automatic seizure detection can help improve a patient's interaction with her/his environment, and while many approaches have been proposed the problem is still not trivially solved. Methods: In this work, we present a novel methodology for feature extraction on EEG signals that allows us to perform a highly accurate classification of epileptic states. Specifically, Hölderian regularity and the Matching Pursuit algorithm are used as the main feature extraction techniques, and are combined with basic statistical features to construct the final feature sets. These sets are then delivered to a Random Forests classification algorithm to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic readings. Results: Several versions of the basic problem are tested and statistically validated producing perfect accuracy in most problems and 97.6% accuracy on the most difficult case. Comparison with existing methods: A comparison with recent literature, using a well known database, reveals that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art performance. Conclusions: The experimental results show that epileptic states can be accurately detected by combining features extracted through regularity analysis, the Matching Pursuit algorithm and simple time-domain statistical analysis. Therefore, the proposed method should be considered as a promising approach for automatic EEG analysis.\", 'Standardized input function for <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET studies in mice: A cautionary study. Aim of the Study The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a standardized arterial input function (SAIF) for positron emission tomography 18F-FDG studies in mice. In particular, we tested whether the same SAIF could be applied to populations of mice whose fasting conditions differed. Methods The SAIF was first created from a population of fasting mice (n = 11) and validated within this group using a correlation analysis and a leave-one-out procedure. Then, the SAIF was prospectively applied to a population of non-fasting mice (n = 16). The SAIFs were scaled using a single individual blood sample taken 25 min after injection. The metabolic rates of glucose (CMRglc) calculated with the SAIFs were compared with the reference values obtained by full arterial sampling (AIF). Results In both populations of mice, CMRglc values showed a very small bias but an important variability. The SAIF/AIF CMRglc ratio in the fasting mice was 0.97 ± 0.22 (after excluding a major outlier). The SAIF/AIF CMRglc ratio in the non-fasting mice was 1.04 ± 0.22. This variability was due to the presence of cases in which the SAIF poorly estimated the shape of the input function based on full arterial sampling. Conclusion Although SAIF allows the estimation of the 18F-FDG mice input function with negligible bias and independently from the fasting state, errors in individual mice (as high as 30-50%) cause an important variability. Alternative techniques, such as image-derived input function, might be a better option for mice PET studies.', 'Inaugural tumor-like multiple sclerosis: clinical presentation and medium-term outcome in 87 patients. Background: Tumefactive demyelinating lesions of the central nervous system can be the initial presentation in various pathological entities [multiple sclerosis (the most common), Balo’s concentric sclerosis, Schilder’s disease and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis] with overlapping clinical presentation. The aim of our study was to better characterize these patients. Methods: Eighty-seven patients (62 women and 25 men) from different MS centers in France were studied retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were (1) a first clinical event (2) MRI showing one or more large demyelinating lesions (20\\xa0mm or more in diameter) with mass-like features. Patients with a previous demyelinating event (i.e. confirmed multiple sclerosis) were excluded. Results: Mean age at onset was 26\\xa0years. The most common initial symptoms (67% of the patients) were hemiparesis or hemiplegia. Aphasia, headache and cognitive disturbances (i.e. atypical symptoms for demyelinating diseases) were observed in 15, 18 and 15% of patients, respectively. The mean largest diameter of the tumefactive lesions was 26.9\\xa0mm, with gadolinium enhancement in 66 patients (81%). Twenty-one patients (24%) had a single tumefactive lesion. During follow-up (median time 5.7\\xa0years) 4 patients died, 70 patients improved or remained stable and 12 worsened. 86% of patients received initial corticosteroid treatment, and 73% received disease-modifying therapy subsequently. EDSS at the end of the follow-up was 2.4 ± 2.6 (mean ± SD). Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that the clinical course of MS presenting with large focal tumor-like lesions does not differ from that of classical relapsing-remitting MS, once the noisy first relapsing occurred.', 'Synucleinopathy alters nanoscale organization and diffusion in the brain extracellular space through hyaluronan remodeling. In recent years, exploration of the brain extracellular space (ECS) has made remarkable progress, including nanoscopic characterizations. However, whether ECS precise conformation is altered during brain pathology remains unknown. Here we study the nanoscale organization of pathological ECS in adult mice under degenerative conditions. Using electron microscopy in cryofixed tissue and single nanotube tracking in live brain slices combined with super-resolution imaging analysis, we find enlarged ECS dimensions and increased nanoscale diffusion after α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration. These animals display a degraded hyaluronan matrix in areas close to reactive microglia. Furthermore, experimental hyaluronan depletion in vivo reduces dopaminergic cell loss and α-synuclein load, induces microgliosis and increases ECS diffusivity, highlighting hyaluronan as diffusional barrier and local tissue organizer. These findings demonstrate the interplay of ECS, extracellular matrix and glia in pathology, unraveling ECS features relevant for the α-synuclein propagation hypothesis and suggesting matrix manipulation as a disease-modifying strategy.', \"Gray Matter–White Matter De-Differentiation on Brain Computed Tomography Predicts Brain Death Occurrence. Background Previous studies have shown that a loss of distinction between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) on unenhanced CT scans was predictive of poor outcome after cardiac arrest. The aim of this study was to identify a marker/predictor of imminent brain death. Methods In this retrospective study, 15 brain-dead patients after anoxia and cardiac arrest were included. Patients were paired (1:1) with normal control subjects. Only patient's unenhanced CT scans performed before brain death and during the 24 hours after initial signs were analyzed. WM and GM densities were measured in predefined regions of interest (basal ganglia level, centrum semi-ovale level, high convexity level, brainstem level). At each level, GM and WM density and GM/WM ratio for brain-dead patients and normal control subjects were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results At each level, a lower GM/WM ratio and decreased GM and WM densities were observed in brain-dead patient's CT scans when compared with normal control subject CT scans. A cut-off value of 1.21\\xa0at the basal ganglia level was identified, below which brain death systematically occurred. Conclusions GM/WM dedifferentiation on unenhanced CT scan is measurable before the occurrence of brain death, highlighting its importance in brain death prediction. The mechanism of GM/WM differentiation loss could be explained by the lack of oxygen caused by ischemia initially affecting the mitochondrial system.\", 'Arterial Spin Labeling and Central Precocious Puberty. Purpose: To evaluate a\\xa0non-invasive method to assess the progressivity of idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) by quantifying perfusion of the pituitary stalk with arterial spin labeling (ASL) and using the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test as a\\xa0reference test to define progressive CPP. Methods: In a\\xa0single center retrospective study, 52\\xa0consecutive patients, observed between October 2015 and April 2017 and referred with early signs of puberty, were evaluated using the GnRH test and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with peripheral or non-idiopathic puberty were excluded. The distribution of perfusion values between patients with progressive and non-progressive CPP was compared using a\\xa0nonparametric Mann-Whitney U‑test. Results: In this study 35 patients were included and 29 had progressive CPP. These patients displayed significantly higher cerebral blood flow (CBF) values than the 6\\xa0patients with non-progressive CPP (p\\u202f= 0.006). The median CBF for patients with non-progressive and progressive CPP was 45.25\\u202fml/min/100\\u202fg (interquartile range 36.9–54) vs. 65\\u202fml/min/100\\u202fg (interquartile range 55.5–74.5), respectively. To determine if the CPP was progressive, the best CBF threshold was 55.5\\u202fml/min/100\\u202fg with a\\xa0sensitivity of 76%, a\\xa0specificity of 83% and an accuracy of 77%. There were strong significant correlations between CBF and LH peak (r\\u202f= 0.67, p\\u202f< 0.001) and between CBF and LH/FSH peaks ratio [r\\u202f= 0.71, p\\u202f< 0.001] during the GnRH test. Conclusion: Arterial spin labelling (ASL) offers a\\xa0novel tool to assess the progressivity of idiopathic CPP.', \"Misconceptions about speech impairment in Parkinson's disease. \", 'Whole-Brain High-Resolution Structural Connectome: Inter-Subject Validation and Application to the Anatomical Segmentation of the Striatum. The present study describes extraction of high-resolution structural connectome (HRSC) in 99 healthy subjects, acquired and made available by the Human Connectome Project. Single subject connectomes were then registered to the common surface space to allow assessment of inter-individual reproducibility of this novel technique using a leave-one-out approach. The anatomic relevance of the surface-based connectome was examined via a clustering algorithm, which identified anatomic subdivisions within the striatum. The connectivity of these striatal subdivisions were then mapped on the cortical and other subcortical surfaces. Findings demonstrate that HRSC analysis is robust across individuals and accurately models the actual underlying brain networks related to the striatum. This suggests that this method has the potential to model and characterize the healthy whole-brain structural network at high anatomic resolution.', 'CD49d/CD29-integrin controls the accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the CNS during neuroinflammation. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are found in the CNS during neuroinflammation and have been reported to exert regulatory functions in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the mechanisms of entry of pDCs into the CNS as well as their phenotype and innate functional properties, once recruited into the CNS, have not been thoroughly examined. Herein, we show that pDCs rapidly accumulate into the brain and spinal cord during the acute phase of EAE, and maintain the expression of numerous phenotypic markers typical of peripheral pDCs. Functionally, CNS-pDCs constitutively expressed IRF7 and were able to rapidly produce type I IFNs and IL-12p40 upon ex vivo TLR-9 stimulation. Using adoptive transfer experiments, we provide evidence that CNS-pDC are recruited from the blood and accumulate into the CNS during the acute phase of EAE. Accumulation of pDCs into the CNS was strongly inhibited in the absence of CD29, but not CD18, suggesting a major role for ß1 but not ß2 integrins. Indeed, blocking the CD49d α4-integrins during acute EAE drastically diminished CNS-pDC numbers. Together, our results demonstrate that circulating pDCs are actively recruited into the CNS during acute EAE through a mechanism largely dependent on CD49d/CD29-integrins.', 'Large-Scale Phenomic and Genomic Analysis of Brain Asymmetrical Skew. The human cerebral hemispheres show a left-right asymmetrical torque pattern, which has been claimed to be absent in chimpanzees. The functional significance and developmental mechanisms are unknown. Here, we carried out the largest-ever analysis of global brain shape asymmetry in magnetic resonance imaging data. Three population datasets were used, UK Biobank (N = 39 678), Human Connectome Project (N = 1113), and BIL&GIN (N = 453). At the population level, there was an anterior and dorsal skew of the right hemisphere, relative to the left. Both skews were associated independently with handedness, and various regional gray and white matter metrics oppositely in the two hemispheres, as well as other variables related to cognitive functions, sociodemographic factors, and physical and mental health. The two skews showed single nucleotide polymorphisms-based heritabilities of 4-13%, but also substantial polygenicity in causal mixture model analysis, and no individually significant loci were found in genome-wide association studies for either skew. There was evidence for a significant genetic correlation between horizontal brain skew and autism, which requires future replication. These results provide the first large-scale description of population-average brain skews and their inter-individual variations, their replicable associations with handedness, and insights into biological and other factors which associate with human brain asymmetry.', 'BioPyC, an open-source python toolbox for offline electroencephalographic and physiological signals classification. Research on brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) has become more democratic in recent decades, and experiments using electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCIs has dramatically increased. The variety of protocol designs and the growing interest in physiological computing require parallel improvements in processing and classification of both EEG signals and bio signals, such as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) or breathing. If some EEG-based analysis tools are already available for online BCIs with a number of online BCI platforms (e.g., BCI2000 or OpenViBE), it remains crucial to perform offline analyses in order to design, select, tune, validate and test algorithms before using them online. Moreover, studying and comparing those algorithms usually requires expertise in programming, signal processing and machine learning, whereas numerous BCI researchers come from other backgrounds with limited or no training in such skills. Finally, existing BCI toolboxes are focused on EEG and other brain signals but usually do not include processing tools for other bio signals. Therefore, in this paper, we describe BioPyC, a free, open-source and easy-to-use Python platform for offline EEG and biosignal processing and classification. Based on an intuitive and well-guided graphical interface, four main modules allow the user to follow the standard steps of the BCI process without any programming skills: (1) reading different neurophysiological signal data formats, (2) filtering and representing EEG and bio signals, (3) classifying them, and (4) visualizing and performing statistical tests on the results. We illustrate BioPyC use on four studies, namely classifying mental tasks, the cognitive workload, emotions and attention states from EEG signals.', 'Ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide enhancement is associated with higher loss of brain tissue structure in clinically isolated syndrome. Background: Macrophages are important components of inflammatory processes in multiple sclerosis, closely linked to axonal loss, and can now be observed in vivo using ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO). In the present 1-year longitudinal study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact on tissue injury of macrophage infiltration in patients after the first clinical event of multiple sclerosis. Methods: Thirty-five patients, 32 years mean age, were imaged in a mean of 66 days after their first event using conventional magnetic resonance imaging, gadolinium (Gd) to probe blood-brain barrier integrity, USPIO to study macrophage infiltration and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) to assess tissue structure integrity. Statistics were performed using two-group repeated-measures ANOVA. Any patient received treatment at baseline. Results: At baseline, patients showed 17 USPIO-positive lesions reflecting infiltration of macrophages present from the onset. This infiltration was associated with local higher loss of tissue structure as emphasized by significant lower MTRnorm values (p<0.03) in USPIO+/Gd+ lesions (n=16; MTRnormUSPIO+/Gd+=0.78 at baseline, MTRnormUSPIO+/Gd+=0.81 at M12) relative to USPIO-/Gd+ lesions (n=67; MTRnormUSPIO-/Gd+=0.82 at baseline, MTRnormUSPIO-/Gd+=0.85 at M12). No interaction in MTR values was observed during the 12 months follow-up (lesion type × time). Conclusion: Infiltration of activated macrophages evidenced by USPIO enhancement, is present at the onset of multiple sclerosis and is associated with higher and persistent local loss of tissue structure. Macrophage infiltration affects more tissue structure while tissue recovery during the following year has a similar pattern for USPIO and Gd-enhanced lesions, leading to relative higher persistent local loss of tissue structure in lesions showing USPIO enhancement at baseline.', 'An enhanced experimental procedure to rationalize on the impairment of perception of action capabilities. It is well documented that changes in the physiological states of the perceiver–actor influence the perception of action capabilities. However, because experimental procedures of most studies involved a limitless availability for stimuli visual encoding and perceptual strategies, it remains difficult to adopt a single position among the large range of alternative interpretations for impaired perception. A reaching-to-grasp paradigm under breathing restriction was adapted from Graydon et al. (Cogn Emot 26:1301–1305, 2012) to standardize the time for encoding of stimuli information and narrowed the involvement of perceptual strategies. In the present study, we propose a highly controlled environment where the discrete information is presented during 300\\xa0ms, congruently with neurophysiological studies focused on visuomotor transformation. An underestimation of the perception of action capabilities is found under breath restriction, suggesting that 300\\xa0ms for stimuli encoding is sufficient to induce altered visuomotor brain transformations when limiting the involvement of perceptual strategies. This result suggests that such behavior could refer to an impaired brain potentiation of the perceptual occurrence, providing strong hypotheses on the brain dynamics of sensorimotor integration that underlie impaired perception of action capabilities in stressful situations.', \"Typicality of functional connectivity robustly captures motion artifacts in rs-fMRI across datasets, atlases, and preprocessing pipelines. Functional connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI data has recently become one of the most common approaches to characterizing individual brain function. It has been widely suggested that the functional connectivity matrix is a useful approximate representation of the brain's connectivity, potentially providing behaviorally or clinically relevant markers. However, functional connectivity estimates are known to be detrimentally affected by various artifacts, including those due to in-scanner head motion. Moreover, as individual functional connections generally covary only very weakly with head motion estimates, motion influence is difficult to quantify robustly, and prone to be neglected in practice. Although the use of individual estimates of head motion, or group-level correlation of motion and functional connectivity has been suggested, a sufficiently sensitive measure of individual functional connectivity quality has not yet been established. We propose a new intuitive summary index, Typicality of Functional Connectivity, to capture deviations from standard brain functional connectivity patterns. In a resting-state fMRI dataset of 245 healthy subjects, this measure was significantly correlated with individual head motion metrics. The results were further robustly reproduced across atlas granularity, preprocessing options, and other datasets, including 1,081 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. In principle, Typicality of Functional Connectivity should be sensitive also to other types of artifacts, processing errors, and possibly also brain pathology, allowing extensive use in data quality screening and quantification in functional connectivity studies as well as methodological investigations.\", 'Sensory, cognitive, and sensorimotor learning effects in recognition memory for music. Recent research suggests that perception and action are strongly interrelated and that motor experience may aid memory recognition. We investigated the role of motor experience in auditory memory recognition processes by musicians using behavioral, ERP, and neural source current density measures. Skilled pianists learned one set of novel melodies by producing them and another set by perception only. Pianists then completed an auditory memory recognition test during which the previously learned melodies were presented with or without an out-of-key pitch alteration while the EEG was recorded. Pianists indicated whether each melody was altered from or identical to one of the original melodies. Altered pitches elicited a larger N2 ERP component than original pitches, and pitches within previously produced melodies elicited a larger N2 than pitches in previously perceived melodies. Cortical motor planning regions were more strongly activated within the time frame of the N2 following altered pitches in previously produced melodies compared with previously perceived melodies, and larger N2 amplitudes were associated with greater detection accuracy following production learning than perception learning. Early sensory (N1) and later cognitive (P3a) components elicited by pitch alterations correlated with predictions of sensory echoic and schematic tonality models, respectively, but only for the perception learning condition, suggesting that production experience alters the extent to which performers rely on sensory and tonal recognition cues. These findings provide evidence for distinct time courses of sensory, schematic, and motoric influences within the same recognition task and suggest that learned auditory–motor associations influence responses to out-of-key pitches.', 'A new family with an SLC9A6 mutation expanding the phenotypic spectrum of Christianson syndrome. Using targeted next generation sequencing, we have identified a splicing mutation (c.526-9_526-5del) in the SLC9A6 gene in a 9-year-old boy with mild intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly, and social interaction disabilities. This intronic microdeletion leads to the skipping of exon 3 and to an in-frame deletion of 26 amino acids in the TM4 domain. It segregates with cognitive impairment or learning difficulties in other members of the family. Mutations in SLC9A6 have been reported in X-linked Christianson syndrome associating severe to profound intellectual deficiency and an Angelman-like phenotype with microcephaly, absent speech, ataxia with progressive cerebellar atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, epilepsy, and neurological regression. The proband and his maternal uncle both have an attenuated phenotype with mild ID, attention deficit disorder, speech difficulties, and mild asymptomatic cerebellar atrophy. The proband also have microcephaly. The mutation cosegregated with learning disabilities and speech difficulties in the female carriers (mother and three sisters of the proband). Detailed neuropsychological, speech, and occupational therapy investigations in the female carriers revealed impaired oral and written language acquisition, with dissociation between verbal and performance IQ. An abnormal phenotype, ranging from learning disability with predominant speech difficulties to mild intellectual deficiency, has been described previously in a large proportion of female carriers. Besides broadening the clinical spectrum of SLC9A6 gene mutations, we present an example of a monogenic origin of mild learning disability. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'Expanding the spectrum of PEX10-related peroxisomal biogenesis disorders: slowly progressive recessive ataxia. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) consist of a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive diseases, in which peroxisome assembly and proliferation are impaired leading to severe multisystem disease and early death. PBDs include Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) with a relatively mild clinical phenotype caused by PEX1, (MIM# 602136), PEX2 (MIM# 170993), PEX6 (MIM# 601498), PEX10 (MIM# 602859), PEX12 (MIM# 601758), and PEX16 (MIM# 603360) mutations. Three adult patients are reported belonging to a non-consanguineous French family affected with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, axonal neuropathy, and pyramidal signs. Mental retardation and diabetes mellitus were optional. The age at onset was in childhood or in adolescence (3–15\\xa0years). Brain MRI showed marked cerebellar atrophy. Biochemical blood analyses suggested a mild peroxisomal defect. With whole exome sequencing, two mutations in PEX10 were found in the three patients: c.827G>T (novel) causing the missense change p.Cys276Phe and c.932G>A causing the missense change p.Arg311Gln. The phenotypic spectrum related to PEX10 mutations includes slowly progressive, syndromic recessive ataxia.', 'Optimal control design of preparation pulses for contrast optimization in MRI. This work investigates the use of MRI radio-frequency (RF) pulses designed within the framework of optimal control theory for image contrast optimization. The magnetization evolution is modeled with Bloch equations, which defines a dynamic system that can be controlled via the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP). This framework allows the computation of optimal RF pulses that bring the magnetization to a given state to obtain the desired contrast after acquisition. Creating contrast through the optimal manipulation of Bloch equations is a new way of handling contrast in MRI, which can explore the theoretical limits of the system. Simulation experiments carried out on-resonance quantify the contrast improvement when compared to standard T1 or T2 weighting strategies. The use of optimal pulses is also validated for the first time in both in vitro and in vivo experiments on a small-animal 4.7\\xa0T MR system. Results demonstrate their robustness to static field inhomogeneities as well as the fact that they can be embedded in standard imaging sequences without affecting standard parameters such as slice selection or echo type. In vivo results on rat and mouse brains illustrate the ability of optimal contrast pulses to create non-trivial contrasts on well-studied structures (white matter versus gray matter).', 'Fronto-central P3a to distracting sounds: An index of their arousing properties. The P3a observed after novel events is an event-related potential comprising an early fronto-central phase and a late fronto-parietal phase. It has classically been considered to reflect the attention processing of distracting stimuli. However, novel sounds can lead to behavioral facilitation as much as behavioral distraction. This illustrates the duality of the orienting response which includes both an attentional and an arousal component. Using a paradigm with visual or auditory targets to detect and irrelevant unexpected distracting sounds to ignore, we showed that the facilitation effect by distracting sounds is independent of the target modality and endures more than 1500 ms. These results confirm that the behavioral facilitation observed after distracting sounds is related to an increase in unspecific phasic arousal on top of the attentional capture. Moreover, the amplitude of the early phase of the P3a to distracting sounds positively correlated with subjective arousal ratings, contrary to other event-related potentials. We propose that the fronto-central early phase of the P3a would index the arousing properties of distracting sounds and would be linked to the arousal component of the orienting response. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the P3a as a marker of distraction.', 'Influence of stroke infarct location on quality of life assessed in a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping study. Stroke has a deleterious impact on quality of life. However, it is less well known if stroke lesions in different brain regions are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). We therefore investigated this association by multivariate lesion-symptom mapping. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the WAKE-UP trial. European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level questionnaires were completed 90\\xa0days after stroke. Lesion symptom mapping was performed using a multivariate machine learning algorithm (support vector regression) based on stroke lesions 22-36\\xa0h after stroke. Brain regions with significant associations were explored in reference to white matter tracts. Of 503 randomized patients, 329 were included in the analysis (mean age 65.4\\xa0years, SD 11.5; median NIHSS\\u2009=\\u20096, IQR 4-9; median EQ-5D score 90\\xa0days after stroke 1, IQR 0-4, median lesion volume 3.3\\xa0ml, IQR 1.1-16.9\\xa0ml). After controlling for lesion volume, significant associations between lesions and EQ-5D score were detected for the right putamen, and internal capsules of both hemispheres. Multivariate lesion inference analysis revealed an association between injuries of the cortico-spinal tracts with worse self-reported quality of life 90\\xa0days after stroke in comparably small stroke lesions, extending previous reports of the association of striato-capsular lesions with worse functional outcome. Our findings are of value to identify patients at risk of impaired QoL after stroke.', 'Frequency and topography of small cerebrovascular lesions in vascular and in mixed dementia: A post-mortem 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging study with neuropathological correlates. Introduction: Mixed dementia (MixD) refers to a combination of definite Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) and vascular encephalopathy. The existence of a \"pure\" type of vascular dementia (VaD) is controversial. There is a need to find magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics allowing the distinction between VaD and MixD. The present post-mortem 7.0-Tesla MRI compares the frequency or severity and the topography of the small cerebrovascular lesions in brains of patients with VaD and with MixD. Material and methods: Based on neuropathological criteria, 14 brains were classified as VaD, 24 as MixD and 11 as controls. Three coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere and a horizontal section of a cerebellar hemisphere underwent T2 and T2∗ 7.0-Tesla MRI examination. The mean values and topographic distribution of white matter changes (WMCs), lacunar infarcts (LIs), cortical microbleeds (CoMBs) and cortical microinfarcts (CoMIs) were determined and compared between the different groups. Results: Compared to the controls, both VaD and MixD brains had significantly more severe WMCs and increased numbers of CoMBs and CoMIs. Lacunar infarcts predominated only in the VaD cases. On mutual comparison of VaD and MixD brains, CoMBs and CoMIs predominated in the frontal lobe and the cerebellum of VaD, while were mainly present in the occipital lobe of MixD. White matter changes predominated in the temporal lobe of MixD cases. Lacunar infarcts were significantly increased in the corona radiata and putamen of VaD patients. Conclusions: The present post-mortem MRI study shows clear differences in the distribution and the types of cerebrovascular lesions on high-field MRI, confirming that VaD and MixD are different diseases.', 'Human-lineage-specific genomic elements are associated with neurodegenerative disease and APOE transcript usage. Knowledge of genomic features specific to the human lineage may provide insights into brain-related diseases. We leverage high-depth whole genome sequencing data to generate a combined annotation identifying regions simultaneously depleted for genetic variation (constrained regions) and poorly conserved across primates. We propose that these constrained, non-conserved regions (CNCRs) have been subject to human-specific purifying selection and are enriched for brain-specific elements. We find that CNCRs are depleted from protein-coding genes but enriched within lncRNAs. We demonstrate that per-SNP heritability of a range of brain-relevant phenotypes are enriched within CNCRs. We find that genes implicated in neurological diseases have high CNCR density, including APOE, highlighting an unannotated intron-3 retention event. Using human brain RNA-sequencing data, we show the intron-3-retaining transcript to be more abundant in Alzheimer’s disease with more severe tau and amyloid pathological burden. Thus, we demonstrate potential association of human-lineage-specific sequences in brain development and neurological disease.', 'A novel disorder of sex development, characterized by progressive regression of testicular function and cystic leukoencephalopathy. We report a novel syndromic disorder of sex development observed in three male siblings, presenting with the association of micropenis without hypospadias, cryptorchidism, very low level of antimüllerian hormone in the neonatal period, and no persistent müllerian duct structures, suggesting a progressive regression of testicular function. The patients described here showed a striking neurological involvement including bilateral periventricular cysts observed in the anterior part of the frontal horns prenatally and increasing in size and number over time, associated with infra and supratentorial parenchymal atrophy, dilated ventricular system, corpus callosum hypoplasia, severe intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Associated features included a distinctive facies, joint contractures, retinopathy, and hearing loss. Pathological examination was consistent with testicular dysgenesis and leukoencephalopathy with spongiosis and microcalcifications. To the best of our knowledge, this disease, characterized by a recognizable pattern of malformations, has not been previously reported. An exhaustive genetic and metabolic evaluation was normal. Autosomal recessive inheritance was considered to be likely, on the basis of SNP studies. We hope that the detailed description provided here of the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings observed in this family will help to identify further unrelated patients, and ultimately, to clarify the genetic basis of this condition. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', \"Brain network remodelling reflects tau-related pathology prior to memory deficits in Thy-Tau22 mice. In Alzheimer's disease, the tauopathy is known as a major mechanism responsible for the development of cognitive deficits. Early biomarkers of such affectations for diagnosis/stratification are crucial in Alzheimer's disease research, and brain connectome studies increasingly show their potential establishing pathology fingerprints at the network level. In this context, we conducted an in vivo multimodal MRI study on young Thy-Tau22 transgenic mice expressing tauopathy, performing resting state functional MRI and structural brain imaging to identify early connectome signatures of the pathology, relating with histological and behavioural investigations. In the prodromal phase of tauopathy, before the emergence of cognitive impairments, Thy-Tau22 mice displayed selective modifications of brain functional connectivity involving three main centres: hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMG) and the isocortical areas, notably the somatosensory (SS) cortex. Each of these regions showed differential histopathological profiles. Disrupted ventral HIP-AMG functional pathway and altered dynamic functional connectivity were consistent with high pathological tau deposition and astrogliosis in both hippocampus and amygdala, and significant microglial reactivity in amygdalar nuclei. These patterns were concurrent with widespread functional hyperconnectivity of memory-related circuits of dorsal hippocampus - encompassing dorsal HIP-SS communication - in the absence of significant cortical histopathological markers. These findings suggest the coexistence of two intermingled mechanisms of response at the functional connectome level in the early phases of pathology: a maladaptive and a likely compensatory response. Captured in the connectivity patterns, such first responses to pathology could further be used in translational investigations as a lead towards an early biomarker of tauopathy as well as new targets for future treatments.\", 'Effects of nutritional state, aging and high chronic intake of sucrose on brain protein synthesis in rats: Modulation of it by rutin and other micronutrients. Little is still known about brain protein synthesis. In order to increase our knowledge of it, we aimed to modulate brain protein synthesis rates through aging, variations in nutritional state (fed state vs. fasted state), high sucrose diet and micronutrient supplementation. Four groups of 16 month-old male rats were fed for five months with a diet containing either 13% or 62% sucrose (wheat starch was replaced with sucrose), supplemented or not with rutin (5 g kg-1 diet), vitamin E (4×), A (2×), D (5×), selenium (10×) and zinc (+44%) and compared with an adult control group. We measured cerebellum protein synthesis and hippocampus gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors. We showed that cerebellum protein synthesis was unchanged by the nutritional state, decreased during aging (-8%), and restored to the adult level by micronutrient supplementation. Sucrose diet did not change protein synthesis but reduced the protein content. Micronutrient supplementation had no effect in sucrose fed rats. Hippocampus gene expressions were affected by age (an increase of TNF-α), sucrose treatment (an increase of IL-1β and IL-6), and micronutrient supplementation (a decrease of heme oxygenase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, TNF-α, and Nrf2). We noted that cerebellum protein synthesis and hippocampus TNF-α gene expression were modulated by the same factors: they were affected by aging and micronutrient supplementation and unchanged by feeding and by high sucrose diet.', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease: An Unusual Cause of Intracranial Vasculitis and Progressive Leukoencephalopathy. Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans histiocytosis affecting multiple organs. Stroke as symptom onset of ECD with intracranial vasculitis is unusual. We report the case of a 64-year-old man who presented with an acute ischemic stroke associated with a moderate leukoencephalopathy and intracranial arteries stenosis. Four years later, he developed movement disorders with dysarthria and cognitive impairment. Neuroradiological findings demonstrated a rapidly progressive and diffuse leukoencephalopathy associated with brain atrophy and infiltration of the intracranial vertebral artery wall. Brain postmortem evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of ECD. This diagnosis should be evoked in patients with cryptogenic stroke, progressive leukoencephalopathy, and infiltration of the arterial wall.', 'Usefulness of head-up tilt test combined with video electroencephalogram to investigate recurrent unexplained atypical transient loss of consciousness. Background: Convulsive syncope and epileptic seizure share many similar clinical features. Early diagnosis is critical for choosing the appropriate management strategy. Aim: Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of an innovative diagnostic strategy — combined head-up tilt test (HUT)/video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring — in patients with unexplained seizure-like transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC). Methods: Combined HUT/video EEG was performed in patients with unexplained atypical T-LOC with both syncope and seizure characteristics remaining undiagnosed after a first-line investigation. T-LOC diagnosis was achieved in case of reproduction of usual symptoms. Events were classified as vasovagal, psychogenic or epilepsy. The link between EEG abnormalities and T-LOC was determined by an epilepsy specialist. Clinical follow-up was performed to assess T-LOC recurrence. Results: Hundred and one consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled (median age 26 [19; 46] years; 72% female) and underwent combined HUT/video EEG between 2007 and 2015. Antiepileptic drugs were being prescribed in 42% of patients. Combined HUT/video EEG was diagnostic in 67% of patients, leading to diagnosis of vasovagal syncope in 59 patients and psychogenic pseudosyncope in nine cases. Antiepileptic drugs were discontinued in 18 patients without epilepsy. Independent predictors of a definitive diagnosis were the presence of prodromal symptoms (odds ratio 5.97, 95% confidence interval 1.37–26; P = 0.017) and a history of myoclonic jerks during T-LOC (odds ratio 4.36, 95% confidence interval 1.71–11.15; P = 0.002). Conclusions: Combined HUT/video EEG is useful for investigating recurrent unexplained atypical seizure-like T-LOC, especially in patients with a history of myoclonic jerks or with documented interictal non-specific EEG abnormalities.', 'Stereoelectroencephalography and surgical outcome in polymicrogyria-related epilepsy: A multicentric study. Objective: We aimed to (1) assess the concordance between various polymicrogyria (PMG) types and the associated epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), and (2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy. Results: Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range, 2–50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia, or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74%, and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but 1 PMG patient with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean, 4.6 years; range, 1–16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom. Interpretation: PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, given that the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. Ann Neurol 2017;82:781–794.', 'The gentle art of saying NO: How nitric oxide gets things done in the hypothalamus. The chemical signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO), which freely diffuses through aqueous and lipid environments, subserves an array of functions in the mammalian central nervous system, such as the regulation of synaptic plasticity, blood flow and neurohormone secretion. In this Review, we consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which NO evokes short-term and long-term changes in neuronal activity. We also highlight recent studies showing that discrete populations of neurons that synthesize NO in the hypothalamus constitute integrative systems that support life by relaying metabolic and gonadal signals to the neuroendocrine brain, and thus gate the onset of puberty and adult fertility. The putative involvement and therapeutic potential of NO in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, for which hormonal imbalances during postnatal development could be risk factors, is also discussed.', 'Is Migraine Associated to Brain Anatomical Alterations? New Data and Coordinate-Based Meta-analysis. A growing number of studies investigate brain anatomy in migraine using voxel- (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM), as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The purpose of this article is to identify consistent patterns of anatomical alterations associated with migraine. First, 19 migraineurs without aura and 19 healthy participants were included in a brain imaging study. T1-weighted MRIs and DTI sequences were acquired and analyzed using VBM, SBM and tract-based spatial statistics. No significant alterations of gray matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness, cortical gyrification, sulcus depth and white-matter tract integrity could be observed. However, migraineurs displayed decreased white matter (WM) volume in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Second, a systematic review of the literature employing VBM, SBM and DTI was conducted to investigate brain anatomy in migraine. Meta-analysis was performed using Seed-based d Mapping via permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) on GM volume, WM volume and cortical thickness data. Alterations of GM volume, WM volume, cortical thickness or white-matter tract integrity were reported in 72%, 50%, 56% and 33% of published studies respectively. Spatial distribution and direction of the disclosed effects were highly inconsistent across studies. The SDM-PSI analysis revealed neither significant decrease nor significant increase of GM volume, WM volume or cortical thickness in migraine. Overall there is to this day no strong evidence of specific brain anatomical alterations reliably associated to migraine. Possible explanations of this conflicting literature are discussed. Trial registration number: NCT02791997, registrated February 6th, 2015.', 'Shared and differential features of Robo3 expression pattern in amniotes. In Bilaterians, commissural neurons project their axons across the midline of the nervous system to target neurons on the opposite side. In mammals, midline crossing at the level of the hindbrain and spinal cord requires the Robo3 receptor which is transiently expressed by all commissural neurons. Unlike other Robo receptors, mammalian Robo3 receptors do not bind Slit ligands and promote midline crossing. Surprisingly, not much is known about Robo3 distribution and mechanism of action in other vertebrate species. Here, we have used whole-mount immunostaining, tissue clearing and light-sheet fluorescent microscopy to study Robo3 expression pattern in embryonic tissue from diverse representatives of amniotes at distinct stages, including squamate (African house snake), birds (chicken, duck, pigeon, ostrich, emu and zebra finch), early postnatal marsupial mammals (fat-tailed dunnart), and eutherian mammals (mouse and human). The analysis of this rich and unique repertoire of amniote specimens reveals conserved features of Robo3 expression in midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord commissural circuits, which together with subtle but meaningful modifications could account for species-specific evolution of sensory-motor and cognitive capacities. Our results also highlight important differences of precerebellar nuclei development across amniotes.', \"Vascular impairment as a pathological mechanism underlying long-lasting cognitive dysfunction after pediatric traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children. Indeed, the acute mechanical injury often evolves to a chronic brain disorder with long-term cognitive, emotional and social dysfunction even in the case of mild TBI. Contrary to the commonly held idea that children show better recovery from injuries than adults, pediatric TBI patients actually have worse outcome than adults for the same injury severity. Acute trauma to the young brain likely interferes with the fine-tuned developmental processes and may give rise to long-lasting consequences on brain's function. This review will focus on cerebrovascular dysfunction as an important early event that may lead to long-term phenotypic changes in the brain after pediatric TBI. These, in turn may be associated with accelerated brain aging and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, since no effective treatments are currently available, understanding the unique pathophysiological mechanisms of pediatric TBI is crucial for the development of new therapeutic options.\", \"Overexpression of α-Synuclein by Oligodendrocytes in Transgenic Mice Does Not Recapitulate the Fibrillar Aggregation Seen in Multiple System Atrophy. The synucleinopathy underlying multiple system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by the presence of abundant amyloid inclusions containing fibrillar α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in the brains of the patients and is associated with an extensive neurodegeneration. In contrast to Parkinson's disease (PD) where the pathological α-syn aggregates are almost exclusively neuronal, the α-syn inclusions in MSA are principally observed in oligodendrocytes (OLs) where they form glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). This is intriguing because differentiated OLs express low levels of α-syn, yet pathogenic amyloid α-syn seeds require significant amounts of α-syn monomers to feed their fibrillar growth and to eventually cause the buildup of cytopathological inclusions. One of the transgenic mouse models of this disease is based on the targeted overexpression of human α-syn in OLs using the PLP promoter. In these mice, the histopathological images showing a rapid emergence of S129-phosphorylated α-syn inside OLs are considered as equivalent to GCIs. Instead, we report here that they correspond to the accumulation of phosphorylated α-syn monomers/oligomers and not to the appearance of the distinctive fibrillar α-syn aggregates that are present in the brains of MSA or PD patients. In spite of a propensity to co-sediment with myelin sheath contaminants, the phosphorylated forms found in the brains of the transgenic animals are soluble (>80%). In clear contrast, the phosphorylated species present in the brains of MSA and PD patients are insoluble fibrils (>95%). Using primary cultures of OLs from PLP-αSyn mice we observed a variable association of S129-phosphorylated α-syn with the cytoplasmic compartment, the nucleus and with membrane domains suggesting that OLs functionally accommodate the phospho-α-syn deriving from experimental overexpression. Yet and while not taking place spontaneously, fibrillization can be seeded in these primary cultures by challenging the OLs with α-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). This indicates that a targeted overexpression of α-syn does not model GCIs in mice but that it can provide a basis for seeding aggregation using PFFs. This approach could help establishing a link between α-syn aggregation and the development of a clinical phenotype in these transgenic animals.\", 'Different shades of default mode disturbance in schizophrenia: Subnodal covariance estimation in structure and function. Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disease with an apparent disruption in the highly associative default mode network (DMN). Interplay between this canonical network and others probably contributes to goal-directed behavior so its disturbance is a candidate neural fingerprint underlying schizophrenia psychopathology. Previous research has reported both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity within the DMN, and both increased and decreased DMN coupling with the multimodal saliency network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN). This study systematically revisited network disruption in patients with schizophrenia using data-derived network atlases and multivariate pattern-learning algorithms in a multisite dataset (n = 325). Resting-state fluctuations in unconstrained brain states were used to estimate functional connectivity, and local volume differences between individuals were used to estimate structural co-occurrence within and between the DMN, SN, and DAN. In brain structure and function, sparse inverse covariance estimates of network coupling were used to characterize healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia, and to identify statistically significant group differences. Evidence did not confirm that the backbone of the DMN was the primary driver of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. Instead, functional and structural aberrations were frequently located outside of the DMN core, such as in the anterior temporoparietal junction and precuneus. Additionally, functional covariation analyses highlighted dysfunctional DMN-DAN coupling, while structural covariation results highlighted aberrant DMN-SN coupling. Our findings reframe the role of the DMN core and its relation to canonical networks in schizophrenia. We thus underline the importance of large-scale neural interactions as effective biomarkers and indicators of how to tailor psychiatric care to single patients.', 'Towards a unified analysis of brain maturation and aging across the entire lifespan: A MRI analysis. There is no consensus in literature about lifespan brain maturation and senescence, mainly because previous lifespan studies have been performed on restricted age periods and/or with a limited number of scans, making results instable and their comparison very difficult. Moreover, the use of nonharmonized tools and different volumetric measurements lead to a great discrepancy in reported results. Thanks to the new paradigm of BigData sharing in neuroimaging and the last advances in image processing enabling to process baby as well as elderly scans with the same tool, new insights on brain maturation and aging can be obtained. This study presents brain volume trajectory over the entire lifespan using the largest age range to date (from few months of life to elderly) and one of the largest number of subjects (N = 2,944). First, we found that white matter trajectory based on absolute and normalized volumes follows an inverted U-shape with a maturation peak around middle life. Second, we found that from 1 to 8–10 y there is an absolute gray matter (GM) increase related to body growth followed by a GM decrease. However, when normalized volumes were considered, GM continuously decreases all along the life. Finally, we found that this observation holds for almost all the considered subcortical structures except for amygdala which is rather stable and hippocampus which exhibits an inverted U-shape with a longer maturation period. By revealing the entire brain trajectory picture, a consensus can be drawn since most of the previously discussed discrepancies can be explained. Hum Brain Mapp 38:5501–5518, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'Brain-Cortex Microglia-Derived Exosomes: Nanoparticles for Glioma Therapy. The function and integrity of the nervous system require interactive exchanges among neurons and glial cells. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a key mediator of intercellular communication, capable of transferring nucleic acids, proteins and lipids influencing numerous functional and pathological aspects of both donor and recipient cells. The immune response mediated by microglia-derived exosomes is most prominently involved in the spread of neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain cancer. Therefore, in the present study we describe a reproducible and highly efficient method for yielding purified primary microglia cells, followed by exosome isolation and their characterization. An in vitro biological assay demonstrates that microglia-derived exosomes tested on a 3D spheroid glioma culture were able to inhibit tumor invasion in time course. These results evidence that brain microglia-derived exosomes could be used as nanotherapeutic agents against glioma cells.', 'Can we boost attention and inhibition in binge drinking? Electrophysiological impact of neurocognitive stimulation. Rationale: Binge drinking (i.e. excessive episodic alcohol consumption) among young adults has been associated with deleterious consequences, notably at the cognitive and brain levels. These behavioural impairments and brain alterations have a direct impact on psychological and interpersonal functioning, but they might also be involved in the transition towards severe alcohol use disorders. Development of effective rehabilitation programs to reduce these negative effects as they emerge thus constitutes a priority in subclinical populations. Objectives: The present study tested the behavioural and electrophysiological impact of neurocognitive stimulation (i.e. transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied during a cognitive task) to improve attention and inhibition abilities in young binge drinkers. Methods: Two groups (20 binge drinkers and 20 non-binge drinkers) performed two sessions in a counterbalanced order. Each session consisted of an inhibition task (i.e. Neutral Go/No-Go) while participants received left frontal tDCS or sham stimulation, immediately followed by an Alcohol-related Go/No-Go task, while both behavioural and electrophysiological measures were recorded. Results: No significant differences were observed between groups or sessions (tDCS versus sham\\xa0stimulation) at the behavioural level. However, electrophysiological measurements during the alcohol-related inhibition task revealed a specific effect of tDCS on attentional resource mobilization (indexed by the N2 component) in binge drinkers, whereas later inhibition processes (indexed by the P3 component) remained unchanged in this population. Conclusions: The present findings indicate that tDCS can modify the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive processes in binge drinking. While the impact of such brain modifications on actual neuropsychological functioning and alcohol consumption behaviours remains to be determined, these results underline the potential interest of developing neurocognitive stimulation approaches in this population.', 'The electrophysiological correlates of developmental dyslexia: New insights from lexical decision and reading aloud in adults. Many studies have described the electrophysiological specificities of print processing in dyslexic readers, mostly using lexical decision tasks. The aim of the present study was twofold: a) to assess for the first time the electrophysiological correlates of print processing in dyslexic adults in the under-investigated context of reading aloud tasks, acknowledged to be especially relevant to investigate phonological processes relatively to lexical decision; and b) to assess whether the electrophysiological specificities described in dyslexic readers in lexical decision correspond to a different neuronal network engaged in print processing. 21 dyslexic university students and matched controls performed a lexical decision task and a reading aloud task on words and pseudowords under EEG recording. In lexical decision, the pattern of results indicates the engagement of similar brain processes between the groups, but with a sub-efficient visual word form processing in dyslexia. In reading aloud, between group differences revealed completely different distributions of the electric field at scalp between the two groups after the N2 time window, suggesting alternative processing strategies in dyslexic readers. Those specificities seem to be related to their core phonological deficits. Crucially, the present results suggest that the nature of electrophysiological divergences in print processing in dyslexic readers vary according to the task: while lexical decision task appears to be well suited to assess divergences in lexical access, reading aloud tasks should also be used in ERP investigation as it allows a better insight into phonological processes and thus be better suited in the framework of the phonological deficit theory of dyslexia.', 'Systems glycomics of adult zebrafish identifies organ-specific sialylation and glycosylation patterns. The emergence of zebrafish Danio rerio as a versatile model organism provides the unique opportunity to monitor the functions of glycosylation throughout vertebrate embryogenesis, providing insights into human diseases caused by glycosylation defects. Using a combination of chemical modifications, enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry analyses, we establish here the precise glycomic profiles of eight individual zebrafish organs and demonstrate that the protein glycosylation and glycosphingolipid expression patterns exhibits exquisite specificity. Concomitant expression screening of a wide array of enzymes involved in the synthesis and transfer of sialic acids shows that the presence of organ-specific sialylation motifs correlates with the localized activity of the corresponding glycan biosynthesis pathways. These findings provide a basis for the rational design of zebrafish lines expressing desired glycosylation profiles.', \"Development of a Scalable, High-Throughput-Compatible Assay to Detect Tau Aggregates Using iPSC-Derived Cortical Neurons Maintained in a Three-Dimensional Culture Format. Tau aggregation is the pathological hallmark that best correlates with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), formed of hyperphosphorylated tau, leads to neuronal dysfunction and loss, and is directly associated with the cognitive decline observed in AD patients. The limited success in targeting β-amyloid pathologies has reinforced the hypothesis of blocking tau phosphorylation, aggregation, and/or spreading as alternative therapeutic entry points to treat AD. Identification of novel therapies requires disease-relevant and scalable assays capable of reproducing key features of the pathology in an in vitro setting. Here we use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a virtually unlimited source of human cortical neurons to develop a robust and scalable tau aggregation model compatible with high-throughput screening (HTS). We downscaled cell culture conditions to 384-well plate format and used Matrigel to introduce an extra physical protection against cell detachment that reduces shearing stress and better recapitulates pathological conditions. We complemented the assay with AlphaLISA technology for the detection of tau aggregates in a high-throughput-compatible format. The assay is reproducible across users and works with different commercially available iPSC lines, representing a highly translational tool for the identification of novel treatments against tauopathies, including AD.\", \"Dairy fat blend improves brain DHA and neuroplasticity and regulates corticosterone in mice. Mimicking the breast milk lipid composition appears to be necessary for infant formula to cover the brain's needs in n-3 PUFA. In this study, we evaluated the impact of partial replacement of vegetable oil (VL) in infant formula by dairy fat (DL) on docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) brain level, neuroplasticity and corticosterone in mice. Mice were fed with balanced VL or balanced DL diets enriched or not in DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA) from the first day of gestation. Brain DHA level, microglia number, neurogenesis, corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor expression were measured in the offsprings. DL diet increased DHA and neuroplasticity in the brain of mice at postnatal day (PND) 14 and at adulthood compared to VL. At PND14, ARA and DHA supplementation increased DHA in VL but not in DL mice brain. Importantly, DHA and ARA supplementation further improved neurogenesis and decreased corticosterone level in DL mice at adulthood. In conclusion, dairy lipids improve brain DHA level and neuroplasticity.\", \"Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Lipids in Experimental Model of Traumatic Brain Injury Detecting Acylcarnitines as Injury Related Markers. Identifying new lipid markers linked to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is of major importance in characterizing their central role in the regeneration process and inflammatory response in such an injury model. In the present study, an advanced lipidomics analysis using high spectral resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging was performed on different brain regions in an experimental rat model of moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) while considering different time points (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 10 days) assessing the acute and subacute phase after injury. Our results revealed a new family of lipids, the acylcarnitines, as TBI-lipid related markers, with maximum expression at 3 days after impact and main colocalization within resident microglia of the brain. Furthermore, our experiments highlighted the upregulation of these acylcarnitine lipids, secreted by microglia, in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, the main region in the brain affected in Parkinson's disease (PD).\", 'Auditory hallucinations and the Brain’s resting-state networks: findings and methodological observations. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential for alterations to the brain’s resting-state networks (RSNs) to explain various kinds of psychopathology. RSNs provide an intriguing new explanatory framework for hallucinations, which can occur in different modalities and population groups, but which remain poorly understood. This collaboration from the International Consortium on Hallucination Research (ICHR) reports on the evidence linking resting-state alterations to auditory hallucinations (AH) and provides a critical appraisal of the methodological approaches used in this area. In the report, we describe findings from resting connectivity fMRI in AH (in schizophrenia and nonclinical individuals) and compare them with findings from neurophysiological research, structural MRI, and research on visual hallucinations (VH). In AH, various studies show resting connectivity differences in left-hemisphere auditory and language regions, as well as atypical interaction of the default mode network and RSNs linked to cognitive control and salience. As the latter are also evident in studies of VH, this points to a domain-general mechanism for hallucinations alongside modality-specific changes to RSNs in different sensory regions. However, we also observed high methodological heterogeneity in the current literature, affecting the ability to make clear comparisons between studies. To address this, we provide some methodological recommendations and options for future research on the resting state and hallucinations.', 'Clinical neurophysiology: The quest to understand motor and postural control. ', 'Identification of bip as a cb1 receptor-interacting protein that fine-tunes cannabinoid signaling in the mouse brain. Cannabinoids, the bioactive constituents of cannabis, exert a wide array of effects on the brain by engaging Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R). Accruing evidence supports that cannabinoid action relies on context-dependent factors, such as the biological characteristics of the target cell, suggesting that cell population-intrinsic molecular cues modulate CB1R-dependent signaling. Here, by using a yeast two-hybrid-based high-throughput screening, we identified BiP as a potential CB1R-interacting protein. We next found that CB1R and BiP interact specifically in vitro, and mapped the interaction site within the CB1R C-terminal (intracellular) domain and the BiP C-terminal (substrate-binding) domain-a. BiP selectively shaped agonist-evoked CB1R signaling by blocking an \"alternative\" Gq/11 protein-dependent signaling module while leaving the \"classical\" Gi/o protein-dependent inhibition of the cAMP pathway unaffected. In situ proximity ligation assays conducted on brain samples from various genetic mouse models of conditional loss or gain of CB1R expression allowed to map CB1R-BiP complexes selectively on terminals of GABAergic neurons. Behavioral studies using cannabinoid- treated male BiP1/2 mice supported that CB1R-BiP complexes modulate cannabinoid-evoked anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis. Together, by identifying BiP as a CB1R-interacting protein that controls receptor function in a signaling pathway- and neuron population-selective manner, our findings may help to understand the striking context-dependent actions of cannabis in the brain.', \"Simultaneous mass spectrometry imaging of multiple neuropeptides in the brain and alterations induced by experimental parkinsonism and L-DOPA therapy. Neuropeptides are important signalling molecules in the brain and alterations in their expression levels have been linked to neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. It is challenging to map neuropeptide changes across and within brain regions because of their low in vivo concentrations and complex post-translational processing. Consequently, the role of neuropeptides in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. Thus, we have developed and evaluated a method to image multiple neuropeptides simultaneously in both rat and primate brain tissue sections by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging at high lateral resolution. Using a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease, we imaged changes in enkephalins, dynorphins, tachykinins and neurotensin associated with the dopaminergic denervation and L-DOPA treatment in multiple brain regions. L-DOPA administration significantly affected neuropeptides in the globus pallidus, while neuropeptides in the caudate-putamen were mostly affected by dopamine depletion. Using high lateral resolution imaging, we observed an increase of neurotensin in the dorsal sub-region of the globus pallidus after dopamine depletion. This study highlights the capacity of mass spectrometry imaging to elucidate the dynamics of neuropeptide signalling during Parkinson's disease and its treatment.\", 'Effects of meditation practice on spontaneous eyeblink rate. A rapidly growing body of research suggests that meditation can change brain and cognitive functioning. Yet little is known about the neurochemical mechanisms underlying meditation-related changes in cognition. Here, we investigated the effects of meditation on spontaneous eyeblink rates (sEBR), a noninvasive peripheral correlate of striatal dopamine activity. Previous studies have shown a relationship between sEBR and cognitive functions such as mind wandering, cognitive flexibility, and attention-functions that are also affected by meditation. We therefore expected that long-term meditation practice would alter eyeblink activity. To test this, we recorded baseline sEBR and intereyeblink intervals (IEBI) in long-term meditators (LTM) and meditation-naive participants (MNP). We found that LTM not only blinked less frequently, but also showed a different eyeblink pattern than MNP. This pattern had good to high degree of consistency over three time points. Moreover, we examined the effects of an 8-week course of mindfulness-based stress reduction on sEBR and IEBI, compared to an active control group and a waitlist control group. No effect of short-term meditation practice was found. Finally, we investigated whether different types of meditation differentially alter eyeblink activity by measuring sEBR and IEBI after a full day of two kinds of meditation practices in the LTM. No effect of meditation type was found. Taken together, these findings may suggest either that individual difference in dopaminergic neurotransmission is a self-selection factor for meditation practice, or that long-term, but not short-term meditation practice induces stable changes in baseline striatal dopaminergic functioning.', 'Pain networks from the inside: Spatiotemporal analysis of brain responses leading from nociception to conscious perception. Conscious perception of painful stimuli needs the contribution of an extensive cortico-subcortical network, and is completed in less than one second. While initial activities in operculo-insular and mid-cingulate cortices have been extensively assessed, the activation timing of most areas supporting conscious pain has barely been studied. Here we used intracranial EEG to investigate the dynamics of 16 brain regions (insular, parietal, prefrontal, cingulate, hippocampal and limbic) during the first second following nociceptive-specific laser pulses. Three waves of activation could be defined according to their temporal relation with conscious perception, ascertained by voluntary motor responses. Pre-conscious activities were recorded in the posterior insula, operculum, mid-cingulate and amygdala. Antero-insular, prefrontal and posterior parietal activities started later and developed during time-frames consistent with conscious voluntary reactions. Responses from hippocampus, perigenual and perisplenial cingulate developed latest and persisted well after conscious perception occurred. Nociceptive inputs reach simultaneously sensory and limbic networks, probably through parallel spino-thalamic and spino-parabrachial pathways, and the initial limbic activation precedes conscious perception of pain. Access of sensory information to consciousness develops concomitant to fronto-parietal activity, while late-occurring responses in the hippocampal region, perigenual and posterior cingulate cortices likely underlie processes linked to memory encoding, self-awareness and pain modulation.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to report the first case of primary vitreoretinal lymphoma in a patient with sarcoid uveitis. Material and Methods: A 63-year-old woman with biopsy-proven sarcoid uveitis diagnosed 7\\xa0years ago was presented for a 6-month history of bilateral intermediate uveitis and gait disturbance with cerebral magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of neurosarcoidosis. Because of corticoids resistance, a vitrectomy and a cerebral biopsy were performed. The final diagnosis was primary central nervous system diffuse lymphoma. Patient died despite the chemotherapy with an initial improvement of visual and neurological features. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists should know that patient followed up with sarcoid uveitis can develop a primary vitreoretinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.', 'Unsupervised lineage-based characterization of primate precursors reveals high proliferative and morphological diversity in the OSVZ. Generation of the primate cortex is characterized by the diversity of cortical precursors and the complexity of their lineage relationships. Recent studies have reported miscellaneous precursor types based on observer classification of cell biology features including morphology, stemness, and proliferative behavior. Here we use an unsupervised machine learning method for Hidden Markov Trees (HMTs), which can be applied to large datasets to classify precursors on the basis of morphology, cell-cycle length, and behavior during mitosis. The unbiased lineage analysis automatically identifies cell types by applying a lineage-based clustering and model-learning algorithm to a macaque corticogenesis dataset. The algorithmic results validate previously reported observer classification of precursor types and show numerous advantages: It predicts a higher diversity of progenitors and numerous potential transitions between precursor types. The HMT model can be initialized to learn a user-defined number of distinct classes of precursors. This makes it possible to 1) reveal as yet undetected precursor types in view of exploring the significant features of precursors with respect to specific cellular processes; and 2) explore specific lineage features. For example, most precursors in the experimental dataset exhibit bidirectional transitions. Constraining the directionality in the HMT model leads to a reduction in precursor diversity following multiple divisions, thereby suggesting that one impact of bidirectionality in corticogenesis is to maintain precursor diversity. In this way we show that unsupervised lineage analysis provides a valuable methodology for investigating fundamental features of corticogenesis.', 'MRI monitoring of temperature and displacement for transcranial focus ultrasound applications. Background: Transcranial focus ultrasound applications applied under MRI-guidance benefit from unrivaled monitoring capabilities, allowing the recording of real-time anatomical information and biomarkers like the temperature rise and/or displacement induced by the acoustic radiation force. Having both of these measurements could allow for better targeting of brain structures, with improved therapy monitoring and safety. Method: We investigated the use of a novel MRI-pulse sequence described previously in Bour et al., (2017) to quantify both the displacement and temperature changes under various ultrasound sonication conditions and in different regions of the brain. The method was evaluated in vivo in a non-human primate under anesthesia using a single-element transducer (f = 850 kHz) in a setting that could mimic clinical applications. Acquisition was performed at 3 T on a clinical imaging system using a modified single-shot gradient echo EPI sequence integrating a bipolar motion-sensitive encoding gradient. Four slices were acquired sequentially perpendicularly or axially to the direction of the ultrasound beam with a 1-Hz update frequency and an isotropic spatial resolution of 2-mm. A total of twenty-four acquisitions were performed in three different sets of experiments. Measurement uncertainty of the sequence was investigated under different acoustic power deposition and in different regions of the brain. Acoustic simulation and thermal modeling were performed and compared to experimental data. Results: The sequence simultaneously provides relevant information about the focal spot location and visualization of heating of brain structures: 1) The sequence localized the acoustic focus both along as well as perpendicular to the ultrasound direction. Tissue displacements ranged from 1 to 2 μm. 2) Thermal rise was only observed at the vicinity of the skull. Temperature increase ranged between 1 and 2 °C and was observed delayed relative the sonication due to thermal diffusion. 3) The fast frame rate imaging was able to highlight magnetic susceptibility artifacts related to breathing, for the most caudal slices. We demonstrated that respiratory triggering successfully restored the sensitivity of the method (from 0.7 μm to 0.2 μm). 4) These results were corroborated by acoustic simulations. Conclusions: The current rapid, multi-slice acquisition and real-time implementation of temperature and displacement visualization may be useful in clinical practices. It may help defining operational safety margins, improving therapy precision and efficacy. Simulations were in good agreement with experimental data and may thus be used prior treatment for procedure planning.', 'In Utero Electroporation to Study Mouse Brain Development. In utero electroporation is a rapid and powerful technique to study the development of many brain regions. This approach presents several advantages over other methods to study specific steps of brain development in vivo, from proliferation to synaptic integration. Here, we describe in detail the individual steps necessary to carry out the technique. We also highlight the variations that can be implemented to target different cerebral structures and to study specific steps of development.', 'A Bottom-Up Approach to Red-Emitting Molecular-Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single-Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue. Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular-based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water-soluble alternative, whose bottom-up design allows for the fine-tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size-tunable, red-emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150\\xa0µm deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.', 'White matter abnormalities of right hemisphere attention networks contribute to visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies. Objective: Functional alterations of the visual attention networks in a setting of impaired visual information processing have a role in the genesis of visual hallucinations (VH) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This multimodal MRI study aims at exploring structural and functional basis of VH. Methods: 23 DLB patients (10 with and 13 without VH) and 13 healthy controls were studied. They underwent MRI with T1-w sequences to measure cortical thickness, DTI for whole-brain and single tract microstructural properties and rs-fMRI of the default mode, dorsal and ventral attention, and visual networks. Results: In DLB with VH, whole-brain DTI revealed a lower fractional anisotropy and a greater mean diffusivity in the right frontal and temporo-parietal white matter tracts. Tracts dissection showed lower fractional anisotropy in the right inferior and superior (ventral part) longitudinal fasciculi (ILF and SLF) (p <.05, corrected), and greater mean diffusivity (p <.05). The extent of white matter microstructural alterations involving the right ILF and SLF correlated with the severity of VH (r =.55, p <.01; r =.42, p <.05, respectively), and with performance in the visual attention task (r = −.56 and r = −.61; p <.01, respectively). Cortical thickness in the projection areas of the right SLF was significantly reduced (p <.05). Patients with VH also showed an altered functional connectivity in the ventral attention network, connected by the ventral portion of the SLF (p <.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a combination of microstructural and functional alterations involving the attention networks in the right hemisphere may be important in the genesis of VH.', \"The increasing impact of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: Essential new insights for clinical practice. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has never been more relevant. The last 5 years have seen a rapid increase in publications and research in the field, with the development of new biomarkers for the disease, thanks to advances in MRI, amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis. The inadvertent development of CAA-like pathology in patients treated with amyloid-beta immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease has highlighted the importance of establishing how and why CAA develops; without this information, the use of these treatments may be unnecessarily restricted. Our understanding of the clinical and radiological spectrum of CAA has continued to evolve, and there are new insights into the independent impact that CAA has on cognition in the context of ageing and intracerebral haemorrhage, as well as in Alzheimer's and other dementias. While the association between CAA and lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (with its high recurrence risk) is now well recognised, a number of management dilemmas remain, particularly when considering the use of antithrombotics, anticoagulants and statins. The Boston criteria for CAA, in use in one form or another for the last 20 years, are now being reviewed to reflect these new wide-ranging clinical and radiological findings. This review aims to provide a 5-year update on these recent advances, as well as a look towards future directions for CAA research and clinical practice.\", \"Glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway and the formation of neuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Chronic neuroinflammation, another hallmark of the disease, is thought to play an important role in the neurodegenerative process. Glycosphingolipids are a well-defined subclass of lipids that regulate crucial aspects of the brain function and recently emerged as potent regulators of the inflammatory process. Deregulation in glycosphingolipid metabolism has been reported in Parkinson’s disease. However, the interrelationship between glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease is not well known. This review provides a thorough overview of the links between glycosphingolipid metabolism and immune-mediated mechanisms involved in neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease. After a brief presentation of the metabolism and function of glycosphingolipids in the brain, it summarizes the evidences supporting that glycosphingolipids (i.e. glucosylceramides or specific gangliosides) are deregulated in Parkinson’s disease. Then, the implications of these deregulations for neuroinflammation, based on data from human inherited lysosomal glycosphingolipid storage disorders and gene-engineered animal studies are outlined. Finally, the key molecular mechanisms by which glycosphingolipids could control neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease are highlighted. These include inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, altered calcium homeostasis, changes in the blood-brain barrier permeability, recruitment of peripheral immune cells or production of autoantibodies.\", 'Testing the physiological plausibility of conflicting psychological models of response inhibition: A forward inference fMRI study. The neural mechanisms underlying response inhibition and related disorders are unclear and controversial for several reasons. First, it is a major challenge to assess the psychological bases of behaviour, and ultimately brain–behaviour relationships, of a function which is precisely intended to suppress overt measurable behaviours. Second, response inhibition is difficult to disentangle from other parallel processes involved in more general aspects of cognitive control. Consequently, different psychological and anatomo-functional models coexist, which often appear in conflict with each other even though they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The standard model of response inhibition in go/no-go tasks assumes that inhibitory processes are reactively and selectively triggered by the stimulus that participants must refrain from reacting to. Recent alternative models suggest that action restraint could instead rely on reactive but non-selective mechanisms (all automatic responses are automatically inhibited in uncertain contexts) or on proactive and non-selective mechanisms (a gating function by which reaction to any stimulus is prevented in anticipation of stimulation when the situation is unpredictable). Here, we assessed the physiological plausibility of these different models by testing their respective predictions regarding event-related BOLD modulations (forward inference using fMRI). We set up a single fMRI design which allowed for us to record simultaneously the different possible forms of inhibition while limiting confounds between response inhibition and parallel cognitive processes. We found BOLD dynamics consistent with non-selective models. These results provide new theoretical and methodological lines of inquiry for the study of basic functions involved in behavioural control and related disorders.', 'Surgical technique. In SEEG, as for any surgical procedure, the benefit/risk ratio is a key-point. This implies rigorous clinical practice in terms of indication, information delivered to the patient, and surgical technique. Numerous technical options may be used to achieve this goal. All are valuable, as long as they are executed with rigor and consistency. Intracranial bleeding represents the main risk of the procedure (1–4% of cases). The procedure also carries a risk of infection (0.8%), death (total of 6 reported cases in all the literature, < 0.002%), and of minor and transient side effects. SEEG is performed under general anesthesia. MRI is the gold standard morphological imaging, used for targeting and for trajectory calculations. It is strictly necessary to use some form of vascular imaging to minimize the peroperative bleeding risk. SEEG can be performed on a frame-based, or frameless, basis, using stereotactic instrumentation, or a neurosurgical robot. Literature does not provide any data in favour of one of these techniques compared to the other. The minimal acceptable bone thickness is considered to be 2 mm. Postoperatively, as soon as any non-preexisting neurological deficit is noticed, neuroimaging must immediately be performed. It is recommended to perform a postoperative imaging during the 24 hours after implantation. The numerous current possibilities, in terms of imaging and technology, give rise to many possible stereotactic strategies for performing SEEG implantation. None of these strategies can be considered as superior to the other. The guarantee of the best possible result is provided by the care with which these procedures are done.', 'SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation. We propose expert recommendations on the use of SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) based on an exhaustive literature review. This technique consists in performing a RF-TC lesion using a SEEG depth electrode at the end of the recording. It is indicated when conventional surgical resection of the ictal onset zone is not possible. SEEG guided RF-TC can also be considered as a diagnostic tool since an improvement, even limited, has a high positive predictive value concerning the good outcome after surgery. It is possible to perform SEEG only in the purposes of performing RF-TC. An over-implantation of the presumed ictal onset zone is possible when such a procedure is planned. The RF-TC target should only be defined based on the ictal activity, except when a type II focal cortical dysplasia electrophysiological interictal signature is recorded. A single or multiple coagulations should always be performed between contiguous electrode contacts. The power delivered by the generator should be increased until the impedance suddenly changes, which indicates that the thermocoagulation has occurred. The procedure should be performed under clinical monitoring without anesthesia and after systematically testing neurological functions by electric stimulation on each target. Multiple SEEG-guided RF-TC can be proposed in a single patient, for example, in cases of relapse after a previous effective procedure. Conventional resection surgery remains feasible after a RF-TC procedure.', 'Choroid plexus glutathione peroxidases are instrumental in protecting the brain fluid environment from hydroperoxides during postnatal development. Hydrogen peroxide, released at low physiological concentration, is involved in different cell signaling pathways during brain development. When released at supraphysiological concentrations in brain fluids following an inflammatory, hypoxic, or toxic stress, it can initiate lipid peroxidation, protein, and nucleic acid damage and contribute to long-term neurological impairment associated with perinatal diseases. We found high glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymatic activities in both lateral and fourth ventricle choroid plexus tissue isolated from developing rats, in comparison to the cerebral cortex and liver. Consistent with these, a high protein expression of glutathione peroxidases 1 and 4 was observed in choroid plexus epithelial cells, which form the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Live choroid plexuses isolated from newborn rats were highly efficient in detoxifying H2O2 from mock cerebrospinal fluid, illustrating the capacity of the choroid plexuses to control H2O2 concentration in the ventricular system of the brain. We used a differentiated cellular model of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier coupled to kinetic and inhibition analyses to show that glutathione peroxidases are more potent than catalase to detoxify extracellular H2O2 at concentrations up to 250 μM. The choroidal cells also formed an enzymatic barrier preventing blood-borne hydroperoxides to reach the cerebrospinal fluid. These data point out the choroid plexuses as key structures in the control of hydroperoxide levels in the cerebral fluid environment during development, at a time when the protective glial cell network is still immature. Glutathione peroxidases are the main effectors of this choroidal hydroperoxide inactivation.', 'Cognition and quality of life in clinically isolated syndrome patients starting a disease modifying therapy in the QUALICIS study may not predict treatment response at one year. Cognition and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are early involved in multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of QUALICIS study was to monitor cognition and HRQoL prospectively in a cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients starting a treatment with subcutaneous beta-1b interferon as a first disease modifying treatment (DMT), and to assess their correlation with the clinical outcome 6 years later. Relapse history, EDSS and yearly standardized brain MRI data were also collected. 37 patients were included. Cognition and HRQoL remained stable over treatment period. At baseline, we found that SDMT was moderately correlated to T2 lesion load (r = − 0.47, p = 0.04). Baseline SDMT was predictive of HRQoL at year 2 (r = 0.53, p = 0.02). Regarding 6-year outcome, the most specific predictive factor of favorable outcome was achieving “No Evidence of Disease Activity” (NEDA) status at year 1. In this group, all the patients had a stable EDSS score and none switched to a second line therapy. In the “non-NEDA” group, 44% of patients experienced EDSS worsening and 38.9% switched to a second line therapy. The number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on baseline scan was the only predictive factor of poor outcome in this subgroup of patients (2 vs. 0.13, p = 0.03). Our results suggest that NEDA at 1 year could be used to predict long term outcome after initiation of DMT in CIS. For non-NEDA patients, monitoring SDMT and brain atrophy could be potentially relevant, but this should be confirmed on a larger sample.', \"17q21.31 duplication causes prominent tau-related dementia with increased MAPT expression. To assess the role of rare copy number variations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a case-control study using whole-exome sequencing data from 522 early-onset cases and 584 controls. The most recurrent rearrangement was a 17q21.31 microduplication, overlapping the CRHR1, MAPT, STH and KANSL1 genes that was found in four cases, including one de novo rearrangement, and was absent in controls. The increased MAPT gene dosage led to a 1.6-1.9-fold expression of the MAPT messenger RNA. Clinical signs, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles were consistent with an AD diagnosis in MAPT duplication carriers. However, amyloid positon emission tomography (PET) imaging, performed in three patients, was negative. Analysis of an additional case with neuropathological examination confirmed that the MAPT duplication causes a complex tauopathy, including prominent neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the medial temporal lobe without amyloid-β deposits. 17q21.31 duplication is the genetic basis of a novel entity marked by prominent tauopathy, leading to early-onset dementia with an AD clinical phenotype. This entity could account for a proportion of probable AD cases with negative amyloid PET imaging recently identified in large clinical series.\", 'Expected susceptibility contrast of the brain structures in normal conditions and in pathological models.

Lesions to the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) in rats produce robust spatial memory deficits that reflect their influence as part of an extended hippocampal system. Recovery of spatial working memory after ATN lesions was examined using a 30-day administration of the neurotrophin cerebrolysin and/or an enriched housing environment. As expected, ATN lesions in standard-housed rats given saline produced severely impaired reinforced spatial alternation when compared to standard-housed rats with sham lesions. Both cerebrolysin and enrichment substantially improved this working memory deficit, including accuracy on trials that required attention to distal cues for successful performance. The combination of cerebrolysin and enrichment was more effective than either treatment alone when the delay between successive runs in a trial was increased to 40\\xa0s. Compared to the intact rats, ATN lesions in standard-housed groups produced substantial reduction in c-Fos expression in the retrosplenial cortex, which remained low after cerebrolysin and enrichment treatments. Evidence that multiple treatment strategies restore some memory functions in the current lesion model reinforces the prospect for treatments in human diencephalic amnesia.', \"Brain processing of pictures of children in men with pedophilic disorder: A positron emission tomography study. Although structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have recently been used to investigate the mechanisms of sexual attraction to children, a hallmark of pedophilic disorder, the differences in the processing of child sexual stimuli between men attracted to children and those attracted to adults remain unclear. Here, our purpose was to identify through positron emission tomography the brain responses of 15 male outpatients with pedophilic disorder to validated visual sexual stimuli depicting children (VSSc) and to compare them with 15 male healthy controls matched for sexual orientation (to female or male adults), age, and handedness. The patients' sample comprised both offenders and non-offenders. In response to VSSc, the between-groups analysis showed that activation in the right inferior temporal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 20] was lower in patients than in controls. Moreover, in patients but not in controls, the presentation of VSSc induced an activation in a more caudal region of the right inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37) and in the left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19). In addition, in patients the level of activation in the caudal right inferior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with ratings of sexual arousal elicited by VSSc, whereas this correlation was negative in BA 20. These results implicate the right inferior temporal gyrus as a possible candidate area mediating sexual arousal in patients with pedophilic disorder and suggest that two of its areas play opposite, i.e., activating and inhibitory, roles.\", 'Full reversal of an atypical right pericallosal artery infarction assessed by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging. ', 'Targeting the Brain with a Neuroprotective Omega-3 Fatty Acid to Enhance Neurogenesis in Hypoxic Condition in Culture. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) is an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that is required for proper brain development and cerebral functions. While DHA deficiency in the brain was shown to be linked to the emergence of cerebral diseases, a dietary intake of omega-3 PUFA could prevent or attenuate neurologic disturbances linked with aging or neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, targeting the brain with DHA might offer great promise in developing new therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously synthesized a stabilized form of DHA-containing lysophosphatidylcholine a major vector of DHA transportation to the brain, which is 1-acetyl,2-docoshexaenoyl-glycerophosphocholine, named AceDoPC®. Injection of AceDoPC® or DHA after experimental ischemic stroke showed that both molecules had neuroprotective effects but AceDoPC® was the most potent. This study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of DHA either unesterified or esterified within AceDoPC® on a model of neurogenesis in vitro, under physiological or pathological conditions. The effect of protectin DX (PDX, a double lipoxygenase product of DHA) was also tested. We cultured neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from the adult mouse brain under normal or hypoxigenic (ischemic) conditions in vitro. Neurogenesis study of cell cultures with AceDoPC® showed enhanced neurogenesis compared to addition of unesterified DHA, PDX, or vehicle control, especially under pathological conditions. Our studies of the potential mechanisms involved in neuroprotection hinted that AceDoPC® neuroprotective and regenerative effects might be due in part to its anti-oxidative effects. These results indicate the potential for novel therapeutics against stroke that target the brain.', 'Central Nervous System Reorganization and Pain after Spinal Cord Injury: Possible Targets for Physical Therapy-A Systematic Review of Neuroimaging Studies. Background: Pain is one of the main symptoms associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) and can be associated with changes to the central nervous system (CNS). Purpose: This article provides an overview of the evidence relating to CNS changes (structural and functional) associated with pain in SCIs. Data Sources: A systematic review was performed, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations, on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in March 2018. Study Selection: Studies were selected if they concerned changes in the CNS of patients with SCI, regardless of the type of imagery. Data Extraction: Data were extracted by 2 blinded reviewers. Data Synthesis: There is moderate evidence for impaired electroencephalographic function and metabolic abnormalities in the anterior cingulate in patients experiencing pain. There is preliminary evidence that patients with pain have morphological and functional changes to the somatosensory cortex and alterations to thalamic metabolism. There are conflicting data regarding the relationships between lesion characteristics and pain. In contrast, patients without pain can display protective neuroplasticity. Limitations and Conclusion: Further studies are required to elucidate fully the relationships between pain and neuroplasticity in patients with SCIs. However, current evidence might support the use of physical therapist treatments targeting CNS plasticity in patients with SCI pain.', 'Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy a potential approach for thrombectomy monitoring. Background and Purpose-Regional brain oxygen saturation (rSO2) changes, assessed by cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy, are likely influenced by cerebral hemodynamic fluctuations induced by thrombectomy of acute proximal occlusion. We studied the correlations between rSO2 and baseline magnetic resonance imaging perfusion parameters and the relationship between rSO2 changes, recanalization, and clinical outcome. Methods-Seventeen acute ischemic stroke patients, treated with mechanical thrombectomy, were monitored using bilateral near-infrared spectroscopy before, during, and continuously for 24 hours after the procedure. All patients had baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging with perfusion weighted imaging. Results-rSO2 was only correlated with baseline Tmax (ρ=-0.42; P<0.05) and mean transit time (ρ=-0.45; P<0.05) within forehead explored areas. Before thrombectomy, an interhemispheric rSO2 difference was noted, and this diminished over time when recanalization had occurred (median [interquartile range], -8 [-12 to -5] to 3 [-3 to 7]; P=0.01). rSO2 changes were not correlated with clinical outcome. Conclusions-rSO2 was merely correlated with baseline Tmax and mean transit time magnetic resonance imaging perfusion parameters. Multiple sites recording beyond frontal pole explored areas may provide more relevant correlation with hemodynamic parameters.', 'Multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesions of unknown significance. Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor of the cerebrum is a rare supratentorial brain tumor described for the first time in 2013. Here, we report 11 cases of infratentorial lesions showing similar striking imaging features consisting of a cluster of low T1-weighted imaging and high T2-FLAIR signal intensity nodules, which we referred to as multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesions of unknown significance. No relationship was found between the location of the lesion and clinical symptoms. A T2-FLAIR hypointense central dot sign was present in images of 9/11 (82%) patients. Cortical involvement was present in 2/11 (18%) of patients. Only 1 nodule of 1 multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesion of unknown significance showed enhancement on postcontrast T1WI. DWI, SWI, MRS, and PWI showed no malignant pattern. Lesions did not change in size or signal during a median follow-up of 3 years, suggesting that multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesions of unknown significance are benign malformative lesions that do not require surgical intervention or removal.', 'Advanced glycation end-products disrupt brain microvascular endothelial cell barrier: The role of mitochondria and oxidative stress. During diabetes mellitus, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are major contributors to the development of alterations in cerebral capillaries, leading to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Consequently, this is often associated with an amplified oxidative stress response in microvascular endothelial cells. As a model to mimic brain microvasculature, the bEnd.3 endothelial cell line was used to investigate cell barrier function. Cells were exposed to native bovine serum albumin (BSA) or modified BSA (BSA-AGEs). In the presence or absence of the antioxidant compound, N-acetyl-cysteine, cell permeability was assessed by FITC-dextran exclusion, intracellular free radical formation was monitored with H2DCF-DA probe, and mitochondrial respiratory and redox parameters were analyzed. We report that, in the absence of alterations in cell viability, BSA-AGEs contribute to an increase in endothelial cell barrier permeability and a marked and prolonged oxidative stress response. Decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption was associated with these alterations and may contribute to reactive oxygen species production. These results suggest the need for further research to explore therapeutic interventions to restore mitochondrial functionality in microvascular endothelial cells to improve brain homeostasis in pathological complications associated with glycation.', 'The gut microbiota to the brain axis in the metabolic control. The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions. The neuronal detection of glucose levels is performed by the autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve innervating the gastro-intestinal tractus, from the mouth to the anus. A dysregulation of this detection leads to the one of the most important current health issue around the world i.e. diabetes mellitus. Furthemore, the consequences of diabetes mellitus on neuronal homeostasis and activities participate to the aggravation of the disease establishing a viscious circle. Prokaryotic cells as bacteria, reside in our gut. The strong relationship between prokaryotic cells and our eukaryotic cells has been established long ago, and prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in our body have evolved synbiotically. For the last decades, studies demonstrated the critical role of the gut microbiota on the metabolic control and how its shift can induce diseases such as diabetes. Despite an important increase of knowledge, few is known about 1) how the gut microbiota influences the neuronal detection of glucose and 2) how the diabetes mellitus-induced gut microbiota shift observed participates to the alterations of autonomic nervous system and the gut-brain axis activity.', 'Cerebral alterations in West African HIV and non-HIV adults aged ≥50: An MRI study. Objectives: To cross-sectionally describe brain alterations in PLHIV aged above 50 years old, receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and living in Senegal compared to HIV-negative subjects. Methods: Twenty PLHIV and 26 HIV-negative subjects with comparable socio-demographic and clinical characteristics underwent an MRI exam (3D-T1 and FLAIR sequences). Global atrophy and White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) were evaluated. After assessing the feasibility and acceptability of MRI scans in this population, we described atrophy and WHM prevalence and associated factors using logistic regressions. Results: Overall, 43.5% of the study sample were aged ≥60 years, 58.7% were women, and 28.3% had hypertension. The overall prevalence of atrophy and WMH was 19.6% [95% CI: 8.1–31.1] and 30.4% [95% CI: 17.1–43.7]. HIV status had no significant effect on atrophy or WMH. Unemployment and hypertension were significantly associated with atrophy, whereas women were less likely to present atrophy. Aged ≥60 years was the only factor associated with WMH. Conclusions: A high prevalence of atrophy and WMH was observed in West African adults aged over 50 years without a clear HIV impact. As brain MRI studies are critical to better understand cognitive and emotional outcomes, we encourage those studies in older PLHIV in West Africa.', 'Brain responses to pictures of children in men with pedophilic disorder: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have recently been used to investigate the mechanisms of sexual attraction to children, a hallmark of pedophilic disorder, and have reported many contradictory or non-replicated findings. Here, our purpose was to identify through functional magnetic resonance imaging the brain responses of 25 male outpatients with pedophilic disorder to visual stimuli depicting children (VSc) and to compare them with 24 male healthy controls matched on sexual orientation (to female or male adults), age, and handedness. No region was differentially activated across the two groups in response to VSc. However, as shown by a random-effects statistical analysis (cluster-level pFWE-corrected < 0.05), in patients with pedophilia, but not in controls, the presentation of VSc induced a bilateral activation in the lateral occipital and temporal cortices, in particular in the right inferior temporal gyrus, as well as an activation in the declive of the cerebellar vermis. In addition, in patients the level of bilateral activation in the above-mentioned regions was positively correlated with ratings of perceived sexual arousal elicited by VSc. These results implicate these regions as possible candidate areas mediating sexual arousal in patients with pedophilic disorder.', 'Multimodal brain imaging connectivity analyses of emotional and motivational deficits in depression among women. Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by impaired cortical–subcortical functional connectivity. Apathy adds to functional impairment, but its cerebral basis in MDD remains unknown. Our objective was to describe impairments in functional connectivity during emotional processing in MDD (with varying levels of congruency and attention), and to determine their correlation with apathy. Methods: We used the Variable Attention Affective Task during functional MRI, followed by diffusion-weighted MRI, to assess 55 right-handed women (30 with MDD and 25 healthy controls) between September 2012 and February 2015. We estimated functional connectivity using generalized psychophysiologic interaction and anatomic connectivity with tract-based spatial statistics. We measured apathy using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Results: We found decreased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during negative stimuli in participants with MDD (t54 = 4.2; p = 0.035, family-wise error [FWE]–corrected). During high-attention stimuli, participants with MDD showed reduced functional connectivity between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the right ACC (t54 = 4.06, pFWE = 0.02), but greater functional connectivity between the right dlPFC and the right amygdala (t54 = 3.35, p = 0.048). Apathy was associated with increased functional connectivity between the right dlPFC and the right ACC during high-attention stimuli (t28 = 5.2, p = 0.01) and increased fractional anisotropy in the right posterior cerebellum, the anterior and posterior cingulum and the bilateral internal capsule (all pFWE < 0.05). Limitations: Limitations included a moderate sample size, concomitant antidepressant therapy and no directed connectivity. Conclusion: We found that MDD was associated with impairments in cortical–subcortical functional connectivity during negative stimuli that might alter the recruitment of networks engaged in attention. Apathy-related features suggested networks similar to those observed in degenerative disorders, but possible different mechanisms.', 'Heme dampens T-cell sequestration by modulating glial cell responses during rodent cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria is the deadliest complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Its pathophysiology is associated with a strong pro-inflammatory reaction and the activation of glial cells. Among modulators released during the infection, heme seems to play a controversial role in the pathophysiology of malaria. Herein, we first investigated the phenotype of glial cells during cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. Given the fact that high levels of heme were associated with cerebral malaria, we then investigated its impact on microglial, astrocyte, and T cell responses to further clarify its contribution in the neuropathophysiology. Surprisingly, we found that administration of heme twice a day from day three of infection induced the expression of the Heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) gene and prevented brain damages. More specifically, heme inhibited the M1 phenotype of microglia, hampered the activation of astrocytes, and decreased the cerebral expression of Ifng, Tnfa and Ip10. Heme might that way alter the migration of pathogenic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes within the brain observed during cerebral malaria. Taking into account that cerebral malaria results from a complex interplay between host- and parasite-derived factors, it is possible that genetic polymorphisms of Hmox1, which could be associated with the control of systemic levels of heme during P. falciparum infection, might explain its dual role and its contribution to the resistance to cerebral malaria.', 'Determinants of brain metabolism changes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Objective To determine the main factors influencing metabolic changes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Methods We prospectively studied 114 patients with MTLE (62 female; 60 left HS; 15- to 56-year-olds) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and correlated the results with the side of HS, structural atrophy, electroclinical features, gender, age at onset, epilepsy duration, and seizure frequency. Imaging processing was performed using statistical parametric mapping. Results Ipsilateral hypometabolism involved temporal (mesial structures, pole, and lateral cortex) and extratemporal areas including the insula, frontal lobe, perisylvian regions, and thalamus, more extensively in right HS (RHS). A relative increase of metabolism (hypermetabolism) was found in the nonepileptic temporal lobe and in posterior areas bilaterally. Voxel-based morphometry detected unilateral hippocampus atrophy and gray matter concentration decrease in both frontal lobes, more extensively in left HS (LHS). Regardless of the structural alterations, the topography of hypometabolism correlated strongly with the extent of epileptic networks (mesial, anterior-mesiolateral, widespread mesiolateral, and bitemporal according to the ictal spread), which were larger in RHS. Notably, widespread perisylvian and bitemporal hypometabolism was found only in RHS. Mirror hypermetabolism was grossly proportional to the hypometabolic areas, coinciding partly with the default mode network. Gender-related effect was significant mainly in the contralateral frontal lobe, in which metabolism was higher in female patients. Epilepsy duration correlated with the contralateral temporal metabolism, positively in LHS and negatively in RHS. Opposite results were found with age at onset. High seizure frequency correlated negatively with the contralateral metabolism in LHS. Significance Epileptic networks, as assessed by electroclinical correlations, appear to be the main determinant of hypometabolism in MTLE. Compensatory mechanisms reflected by a relative hypermetabolism in the nonepileptic temporal lobe and in extratemporal areas seem more efficient in LHS and in female patients, whereas long duration, late onset of epilepsy, and high seizure frequency may reduce these adaptive changes.', 'A review of classification algorithms for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces: A 10 year update. Objective. Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.', 'Cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral blood flows in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a pathology that seems to present hemodynamic and hydrodynamic disturbance. The aim of this study was to establish CSF and blood interaction in IIH. Material and methods: We retrospectively studied cerebral hydrodynamic and hemodynamic flows by phase-contrast MRI (PCMRI) in 13 IIH subjects (according Dandy’s criteria) and 16 controls. We analyzed arterial peak flow, pulsatility index, and resistive index in arterial and venous compartments (PFart, PIart, RIart, PFvein, PIvein, RIvein) and measured arteriovenous and CSF peak flow and stroke volume (PFav, SVVASC, PFCSF, SVCSF). Results: We found no significant difference between IIH and control groups in arterial and venous parameters. Arteriovenous flow analysis showed higher PFav and SVVASC in the IIH group than in the control group (respectively 369 ± 27 mL/min and 286 ± 47 mL/min, p = 0.02; and 1085 ± 265 μL/cardiac cycle and 801 ± 226 μL/cardiac cycle, p = 0.007). PFCSF and SVCSF were higher in the IIH group than in the control group (respectively 206 ± 50 mL/min and 126.6 ± 24.8 mL/min, p = 0.04; and 570 ± 190 μL/cardiac cycle and 430 ± 100 μL/cardiac cycle, p = 0.0007). Conclusion: Although no significant change was found in arterial and venous flows, we showed that a small phase shift of venous outflow might cause an increase in the arteriovenous pulsatility and an increasing brain expansion during the cardiac cycle. This arteriovenous flow increase would result in an increase of CSF flushing through the foramen magnum and an increased ICP.', 'Ventriculomegaly in the elderly: Who needs a shunt? A MRI study on 90 patients. Objective: In the case of ventriculomegaly in the elderly, it is often difficult to differentiate between communicating chronic hydrocephalus (CCH) and brain atrophy. The aim of this study is to describe the MRI criteria of CCH, defined by a symptomatic patient with ventriculomegaly and that improved after shunt placement. Materials and methods: Magnetic resonance imaging was prospectively evaluated in 90 patients with ventriculomegaly. Patients were classified into three groups: patients without clinical signs of CCH (control, n = 47), patients with CCH treated by shunt placement with clinical improvement (responders, n = 36), and patients with CCH treated using a shunt without clinical improvement (nonresponders, n = 7). MRI parameters of the two groups of interest (responders vs. controls) were compared. Results: Compared with controls, Evans’ index (p = 0.029), ventricular area (p < 0.01), and volume (p = 0.0001) were higher in the responders. In this group, the callosal angle was smaller (p ≤ 0.0001) and the aqueductal stroke volume (SVa) of CSF was higher (p ≤ 0.0001) than in controls. On the ROC curves, the optimal cut-off values for differentiating between responders and controls were a ventricular area >33.5 cm2, a callosal angle <90.8° and a SVa > 136.5 μL/R-R. In multivariate analysis, responders remained associated with SVa and callosal angle, with a c-statistic of 0.90 (95%CI, 0.83–0.98). Conclusion: On suspicion of CCH, a large ventricular area, a small callosal angle, and an increased aqueductal stroke volume are important MRI arguments that can be associated with the clinical evaluation and dynamic testing of CSF to confirm the indication for a shunt.', \"MRI predictors of amyloid pathology: Results from the EMIF-AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study. Background: With the shift of research focus towards the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is an urgent need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers to predict amyloid pathology. The aim of this study was to assess whether easily obtainable measures from structural MRI, combined with demographic data, cognitive data and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 genotype, can be used to predict amyloid pathology using machine-learning classification. Methods: We examined 810 subjects with structural MRI data and amyloid markers from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, including subjects with normal cognition (CN, n = 337, age 66.5 ± 7.2, 50% female, 27% amyloid positive), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 375, age 69.1 ± 7.5, 53% female, 63% amyloid positive) and AD dementia (n = 98, age 67.0 ± 7.7, 48% female, 97% amyloid positive). Structural MRI scans were visually assessed and Freesurfer was used to obtain subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and surface area measures. We first assessed univariate associations between MRI measures and amyloid pathology using mixed models. Next, we developed and tested an automated classifier using demographic, cognitive, MRI and APOE ϵ4 information to predict amyloid pathology. A support vector machine (SVM) with nested 10-fold cross-validation was applied to identify a set of markers best discriminating between amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects. Results: In univariate associations, amyloid pathology was associated with lower subcortical volumes and thinner cortex in AD-signature regions in CN and MCI. The multi-variable SVM classifier provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 ± 0.07 in MCI and an AUC of 0.74 ± 0.08 in CN. In CN, selected features for the classifier included APOE ϵ4, age, memory scores and several MRI measures such as hippocampus, amygdala and accumbens volumes and cortical thickness in temporal and parahippocampal regions. In MCI, the classifier including demographic and APOE ϵ4 information did not improve after additionally adding imaging measures. Conclusions: Amyloid pathology is associated with changes in structural MRI measures in CN and MCI. An automated classifier based on clinical, imaging and APOE ϵ4 data can identify the presence of amyloid pathology with a moderate level of accuracy. These results could be used in clinical trials to pre-screen subjects for anti-amyloid therapies.\", \"Functional connectivity disruptions correlate with cognitive phenotypes in Parkinson's disease. Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease are thought to be related to altered functional brain connectivity. To date, cognitive-related changes in Parkinson's disease have never been explored with dense-EEG with the aim of establishing a relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment, on the one hand, and alterations in the functional connectivity of brain networks, on the other hand. This study was aimed at identifying altered brain networks associated with cognitive phenotypes in Parkinson's disease using dense-EEG data recorded during rest with eyes closed. Three groups of Parkinson's disease patients (N\\xa0=\\xa0124) with different cognitive phenotypes coming from a data-driven cluster analysis, were studied: G1) cognitively intact patients (63), G2) patients with mild cognitive deficits (46) and G3) patients with severe cognitive deficits (15). Functional brain networks were identified using a dense-EEG source connectivity method. Pairwise functional connectivity was computed for 68 brain regions in different EEG frequency bands. Network statistics were assessed at both global (network topology) and local (inter-regional connections) level. Results revealed progressive disruptions in functional connectivity between the three patient groups, typically in the alpha band. Differences between G1 and G2 (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001, corrected using permutation test) were mainly frontotemporal alterations. A statistically significant correlation (ρ\\xa0=\\xa00.49, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) was also obtained between a proposed network-based index and the patients’ cognitive score. Global properties of network topology in patients were relatively intact. These findings indicate that functional connectivity decreases with the worsening of cognitive performance and loss of frontotemporal connectivity may be a promising neuromarker of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.\", 'De Novo Missense Variants in FBXW11 Cause Diverse Developmental Phenotypes Including Brain, Eye, and Digit Anomalies. The identification of genetic variants implicated in human developmental disorders has been revolutionized by second-generation sequencing combined with international pooling of cases. Here, we describe seven individuals who have diverse yet overlapping developmental anomalies, and who all have de novo missense FBXW11 variants identified by whole exome or whole genome sequencing and not reported in the gnomAD database. Their phenotypes include striking neurodevelopmental, digital, jaw, and eye anomalies, and in one individual, features resembling Noonan syndrome, a condition caused by dysregulated RAS signaling. FBXW11 encodes an F-box protein, part of the Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and thus fundamental to many protein regulatory processes. FBXW11 targets include β-catenin and GLI transcription factors, key mediators of Wnt and Hh signaling, respectively, critical to digital, neurological, and eye development. Structural analyses indicate affected residues cluster at the surface of the loops of the substrate-binding domain of FBXW11, and the variants are predicted to destabilize the protein and/or its interactions. In situ hybridization studies on human and zebrafish embryonic tissues demonstrate FBXW11 is expressed in the developing eye, brain, mandibular processes, and limb buds or pectoral fins. Knockdown of the zebrafish FBXW11 orthologs fbxw11a and fbxw11b resulted in embryos with smaller, misshapen, and underdeveloped eyes and abnormal jaw and pectoral fin development. Our findings support the role of FBXW11 in multiple developmental processes, including those involving the brain, eye, digits, and jaw.', 'Functional brain connectivity changes across the human life span: From fetal development to old age. The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto-networks, involving mainly within network short-range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40\\xa0years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large-scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.', \"Reduced oligodendrocyte exosome secretion in multiple system atrophy involves SNARE dysfunction. Transportation of key proteins via extracellular vesicles has been recently implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, as a new mechanism of disease spreading and a new source of biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles likely to be derived from the brain can be isolated from peripheral blood and have been reported to contain higher levels of a-synuclein (a-syn) in Parkinson's disease patients. However, very little is known about extracellular vesicles in multiple system atrophy, a disease that, like Parkinson's disease, involves pathological a-syn aggregation, though the process is centred around oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy. In this study, a novel immunocapture technology was developed to isolate blood CNPase-positive, oligodendrocyte-derived enriched microvesicles (OEMVs), followed by fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis and assessment of a-syn levels contained within the OEMVs. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of OEMVs were significantly lower in multiple system atrophy patients, compared to Parkinson's disease patients and healthy control subjects. It is also noted that the population of OEMVs involved was mainly in the size range closer to that of exosomes, and that the average a-syn concentrations (per vesicle) contained in these OEMVs were not significantly different among the three groups. The phenomenon of reduced OEMVs was again observed in a transgenic mouse model of multiple system atrophy and in primary oligodendrocyte cultures, and the mechanism involved was likely related, at least in part, to an a-syn-mediated interference in the interaction between syntaxin 4 and VAMP2, leading to the dysfunction of the SNARE complex. These results suggest that reduced OEMVs could be an important mechanism related to pathological a-syn aggregation in oligodendrocytes, and the OEMVs found in peripheral blood could be further explored for their potential as multiple system atrophy biomarkers.\", 'PRUNE1-related disorder: Expanding the clinical spectrum. Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, hypotonia, and variable brain anomalies (NMIHBA) (OMIM #617481) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive microcephaly, plagiocephaly, hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, optic features and abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). NMIHBA was recently reported to be caused by PRUNE1 mutations. Eight mutations have been reported in 13 unrelated families. Here, we report 3 PRUNE1 mutations in 1 Caucasian and 3 Japanese families. One recurrent missense mutation (p.Asp106Asn) was previously reported in Turkish and Italian families, while the other 2 mutations (p.Leu18Serfs*8 and p.Cys180*) are novel. We also show that mutant PRUNE1 mRNA can be subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The patients presented in this study showed atypical NMIHBA phenotypes with no progressive microcephaly. Furthermore, one Caucasian case had significant macrocephaly; therefore, patients with PRUNE1 mutations can exhibit a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of phenotypes.', 'Heterozygous HTRA1 nonsense or frameshift mutations are pathogenic. Heterozygous missense HTRA1 mutations have been associated with an autosomal dominant cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) whereas the pathogenicity of heterozygous HTRA1 stop codon variants is unclear. We performed a targeted high throughput sequencing of all known CSVD genes, including HTRA1, in 3853 unrelated consecutive CSVD patients referred for molecular diagnosis. The frequency of heterozygous HTRA1 mutations leading to a premature stop codon in this patient cohort was compared with their frequency in large control databases. An analysis of HTRA1 mRNA was performed in several stop codon carrier patients. Clinical and neuroimaging features were characterized in all probands. Twenty unrelated patients carrying a heterozygous HTRA1 variant leading to a premature stop codon were identified. A highly significant difference was observed when comparing our patient cohort with control databases: gnomAD v3.1.1 [P = 3.12 × 10-17, odds ratio (OR) = 21.9], TOPMed freeze 5 (P = 7.6 × 10-18, OR = 27.1) and 1000 Genomes (P = 1.5 × 10-5). Messenger RNA analysis performed in eight patients showed a degradation of the mutated allele strongly suggesting a haploinsufficiency. Clinical and neuroimaging features are similar to those previously reported in heterozygous missense mutation carriers, except for penetrance, which seems lower. Altogether, our findings strongly suggest that heterozygous HTRA1 stop codons are pathogenic through a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Future work will help to estimate their penetrance, an important information for genetic counselling.', \"Biomarker matrix to track short term disease progression in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Background: Assessment of human brain atrophy in temporal regions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting state functional MRI connectivity in the left parietal cortex, and limbic electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms as well as plasma amyloid peptide 42 (Aβ42) has shown that each is a promising biomarker of disease progression in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the value of their combined use is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the association with cognitive decline and the effect on sample size calculation when using a biomarker composite matrix in prodromal AD clinical trials. Methods: Multicenter longitudinal study with follow-up of 2 years or until development of incident dementia. APOE ϵ4-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 /P-tau cut-offs were used to identify aMCI with prodromal AD. Linear mixed models were performed 1) with repeated matrix values and time as factors to explain the longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog13, 2) with CSF Aβ42 /P-tau status, time, and CSF Aβ42 /P-tau status×time interaction as factors to explain the longitudinal changes in matrix measures, and 3) to compute sample size estimation for a trial implemented with the selected matrices. Results: The best composite matrix included the MRI volumes of hippocampal dentate gyrus and lateral ventricle. This matrix showed the best sensitivity to track disease progression and required a sample size 31% lower than that of the best individual biomarker (i.e., volume of hippocampal dentate gyrus). Conclusion: Optimal matrices improved the statistical power to track disease development and to measure clinical progression in the short-term period. This might contribute to optimize the design of future clinical trials in MCI.\", 'Central nervous system involvement in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss): Report of 26 patients and review of the literature. Background Although peripheral nervous system involvement is common in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are poorly described. This study aimed to describe CNS involvement in EGPA. Patients and methods This retrospective, observational, multicenter study included patients with EGPA and CNS involvement affecting cranial nerves, brain and/or spinal cord. We also undertook a systematic literature review. Results We analyzed 26 personal cases and 62 previously reported cases. At EGPA diagnosis, asthma was noted in 97%, eosinophilia in 98%, peripheral neuropathy in 55% and cardiac involvement in 41%. 38/71 (54%) were ANCA-positive, with a perinuclear-labeling pattern and/or anti-MPO specificity. CNS was involved in 86% at EGPA diagnosis, preceded EGPA in 2%, and occurred during follow-up in 12% after a median of 24 months. Main neurological manifestations were ischemic cerebrovascular lesions in 46 (52%), intracerebral hemorrhage and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage in 21 (24%), loss of visual acuity in 28 (33%) (15 with optic neuritis, 9 with central retinal artery occlusion, 4 with cortical blindness), and cranial nerves palsies in 18 (21%), with 25 patients having ≥ 1 of these clinical CNS manifestations. Among the 81 patients with assessable neurological responses, 43% had complete responses without sequelae, 43% had partial responses with long-term sequelae and 14% refractory disease. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 11 patients died including 5 from intracerebral hemorrhages. Conclusion EGPA-related CNS manifestations form 4 distinct neurological pictures: ischemic lesions, intracerebral hemorrhages, cranial nerve palsies and loss of visual acuity. Such manifestation should prompt practitioners to consider EGPA in such conditions. Long-term neurological sequelae were common, and intracerebral hemorrhages had the worst prognostic impact.', 'De Novo Mutations in Protein Kinase Genes CAMK2A and CAMK2B Cause Intellectual Disability. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is one of the first proteins shown to be essential for normal learning and synaptic plasticity in mice, but its requirement for human brain development has not yet been established. Through a multi-center collaborative study based on a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified 19 exceedingly rare de novo CAMK2A or CAMK2B variants in 24 unrelated individuals with intellectual disability. Variants were assessed for their effect on CAMK2 function and on neuronal migration. For both CAMK2A and CAMK2B, we identified mutations that decreased or increased CAMK2 auto-phosphorylation at Thr286/Thr287. We further found that all mutations affecting auto-phosphorylation also affected neuronal migration, highlighting the importance of tightly regulated CAMK2 auto-phosphorylation in neuronal function and neurodevelopment. Our data establish the importance of CAMK2A and CAMK2B and their auto-phosphorylation in human brain function and expand the phenotypic spectrum of the disorders caused by variants in key players of the glutamatergic signaling pathway.', 'AssemblyNet: A large ensemble of CNNs for 3D whole brain MRI segmentation. Abstract Whole brain segmentation of fine-grained structures using deep learning (DL) is a very challenging task since the number of anatomical labels is very high compared to the number of available training images. To address this problem, previous DL methods proposed to use a single convolution neural network (CNN) or few independent CNNs. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble method based on a large number of CNNs processing different overlapping brain areas. Inspired by parliamentary decision-making systems, we propose a framework called AssemblyNet, made of two “assemblies\" of U-Nets. Such a parliamentary system is capable of dealing with complex decisions, unseen problem and reaching a relevant consensus. AssemblyNet introduces sharing of knowledge among neighboring U-Nets, an “amendment” procedure made by the second assembly at higher-resolution to refine the decision taken by the first one, and a final decision obtained by majority voting. During our validation, AssemblyNet showed competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as U-Net, Joint label fusion and SLANT. Moreover, we investigated the scan-rescan consistency and the robustness to disease effects of our method. These experiences demonstrated the reliability of AssemblyNet. Finally, we showed the interest of using semi-supervised learning to improve the performance of our method.', 'Added value of <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben amyloid PET in the diagnostic workup of most complex patients with dementia in France: A naturalistic study. Introduction: Although some studies have previously addressed the clinical impact of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), none has specifically addressed its selective and hierarchical implementation in relation to cerebrospinal fluid analysis in a naturalistic setting. Methods: This multicenter study was performed at French tertiary memory clinics in patients presenting with most complex clinical situations (i.e., early-onset, atypical clinical profiles, suspected mixed etiological conditions, unexpected rate of progression), for whom cerebrospinal fluid analysis was indicated but either not feasible or considered as noncontributory (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02681172). Results: Two hundred five patients were enrolled with evaluable florbetaben PET scans; 64.4% of scans were amyloid positive. PET results led to changed diagnosis and improved confidence in 66.8% and 81.5% of patients, respectively, and altered management in 80.0% of cases. Discussion: High-level improvement of diagnostic certainty and management is provided by selective and hierarchical implementation of florbetaben PET into current standard practices for the most complex dementia cases.', 'Multifocal arterial wall contrast – enhancement in ischemic stroke: A mirror of systemic inflammatory response in acute stroke. Purpose: Intracranial plaque gadolinium enhancement revealed by high-resolution MRI imaging (HR MRI) is considered as a marker of plaque inflammation, a contributing factor of plaque unstability. The aim of the present study was to assess the distribution of gadolinium enhancement in intracranial atherosclerosis. Methods: Single center analysis of ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of M1 or M2 segments of middle cerebral artery, or terminal internal carotid artery (ICA) based on CT-angio or MR-angio. High-resolution MRI imaging (HRMRI) was performed within 6 first weeks following the index event, with 3DT2 BB (black-blood) and 3D T1 BB MR sequences pre and post-contrast administration. Results: We identified 8 patients with 14 plaques, 4 were deemed non-culprit and 10 culprit. All culprit plaques (10/10 plaques) and 3 out of 4 non-culprit plaques showed a gadolinium enhancement. Conclusion: At the acute/subacute stage of stroke, a gadolinium enhancement may affect multiple asymptomatic intracranial plaques and may reflect a global inflammatory state.', 'Preclinical validation of [<sup>18</sup>F]2FNQ1P as a specific PET radiotracer of 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptors in rat, pig, non-human primate and human brain tissue. Introduction: The aim of this study was to perform in-vitro and in-vivo radiopharmacological characterizations of [18F]2FNQ1P, a new PET radiotracer of 5-HT6 receptors, in rat, pig, non-human primate and human tissues. The 5-HT6 receptor is one of the more recently identified serotonin receptors in central nervous system and, because of its role in memory and cognitive processes, is considered as a promising therapeutic target. Methods: In-vitro autoradiography and saturation binding assays were performed in postmortem brain tissues from rat, pig, non-human primate and human caudate nucleus, completed by serum stability assessment in all species and cerebral radiometabolite and biodistribution studies in rat. Results: In all species, autoradiography data revealed high binding levels of [18F]2FNQ1P in cerebral regions with high 5-HT6 receptor density. Binding was blocked by addition of SB258585 as a specific antagonist. Binding assays provided KD and Bmax values of respectively 1.34 nM and 0.03 pmol·mg−1 in rat, 0.60 nM and 0.04 pmol·mg−1 in pig, 1.38 nM and 0.07 pmol·mg−1 in non-human primate, and 1.39 nM and 0.15 pmol·mg−1 in human caudate nucleus. In rat brain, the proportion of unmetabolized [18F]2FNQ1P was >99% 5 min after iv injection and 89% at 40 min. The biodistribution studies found maximal radioactivity in lungs and kidneys (3.5 ± 1.2% ID/g and 2.0 ± 0.7% ID/g, respectively, 15 min post-injection). Conclusion: These radiopharmacological data confirm that [18F]2FNQ1P is a specific radiotracer for molecular imaging of 5-HT6 receptors and suggest that it could be used as a radiopharmaceutical in humans.', 'Electrophysiological Mapping During Brain Tumor Surgery: Recording Cortical Potentials Evoked Locally, Subcortically and Remotely by Electrical Stimulation to Assess the Brain Connectivity On-line. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) is used to perform functional brain mapping during awake surgery and in epileptic patients. DES may be coupled with the measurement of Evoked Potentials (EP) to study the conductive and integrative properties of activated neural ensembles and probe the spatiotemporal dynamics of short- and long-range networks. However, its electrophysiological effects remain by far unknown. We recorded ECoG signals on two patients undergoing awake brain surgery and measured EP on functional sites after cortical stimulations and were the firsts to record three different types of EP on the same patients. Using low-intensity (1–3\\xa0mA) to evoke electrogenesis we observed that: (i) “true” remote EPs are attenuated in amplitude and delayed in time due to the divergence of white matter pathways; (ii) “false” remote EPs are attenuated but not delayed: as they originate from the same electrical source; (iii) Singular but reproducible positive components in the EP can be generated when the DES is applied in the temporal lobe or the premotor cortex; and (iv) rare EP can be triggered when the DES is applied subcortically: these can be either negative, or surprisingly, positive. We proposed different activation and electrophysiological propagation mechanisms following DES, based on the nature of activated neural elements and discussed important methodological pitfalls when measuring EP in the brain. Altogether, these results pave the way to map the connectivity in real-time between the DES and the recording sites; to characterize the local electrophysiological states and to link electrophysiology and function. In the future, and in practice, this technique could be used to perform electrophysiological mapping in order to link (non)-functional to electrophysiological responses with DES and could be used to guide the surgical act itself.', \"Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression Profiling in Adult Mouse Brain Reveals Normal and Disease-State Signatures. The role of brain cell-type-specific functions and profiles in pathological and non-pathological contexts is still poorly defined. Such cell-type-specific gene expression profiles in solid, adult tissues would benefit from approaches that avoid cellular stress during isolation. Here, we developed such an approach and identified highly selective transcriptomic signatures in adult mouse striatal direct and indirect spiny projection neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we obtained a comprehensive model for cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression in the mouse striatum. A cross-analysis with transcriptomic and epigenomic data generated from mouse and human Huntington's disease (HD) brains shows that opposite epigenetic mechanisms govern the transcriptional regulation of striatal neurons and glial cells and may contribute to pathogenic and compensatory mechanisms. Overall, these data validate this less stressful method for the investigation of cellular specificity in the adult mouse brain and demonstrate the potential of integrative studies using multiple databases. The contributions of neuronal and non-neuronal populations in cerebral functions are increasingly studied, but a robust and stress-limited method for cell-type-specific isolation is lacking. Merienne et al. optimize a laser-capture microdissection approach and characterize transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms in normal or pathological mouse and human Huntington's disease (HD) brains.\", 'Neuropathologic, phenotypic and functional analyses of Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells in Multiple Sclerosis. Background: The involvement of Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells, which are anti-microbial semi-invariant T cells, remains elusive in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Objective: Deciphering the potential involvement of MAIT cells in the MS inflammatory process. Methods: By flow cytometry, blood MAIT cells from similar cohorts of MS patients and healthy volunteers (HV) were compared for frequency, phenotype, activation potential after in vitro TCR engagement by bacterial ligands and transmigration abilities through an in vitro model of blood-brain barrier. MS CNS samples were also studied by immunofluorescent staining and quantitative PCR. Results and conclusion: Blood MAIT cells from relapsing-remitting MS patients and HV presented similar frequency, ex vivo effector phenotype and activation abilities. MAIT cells represented 0.5% of the total infiltrating T cells on 39 MS CNS lesions. This is low as compared to blood frequency (p < 0.001), but consistent with their low transmigration rate. Finally, transcriptional over-expression of MR1 - which presents cognate antigens to MAIT cells - and of the activating cytokines IL-18 and IL-23 was evidenced in MS lesions, suggesting that the CNS microenvironment is suited to activate the few infiltrating MAIT cells. Taken together, these data place MAIT cells from MS patients as minor components of the inflammatory pathological process.', 'Perceptual Cycles. Brain function involves oscillations at various frequencies. This could imply that perception and cognition operate periodically, as a succession of cycles mirroring the underlying oscillations. This age-old notion of discrete perception has resurfaced in recent years, fueled by advances in neuroscientific techniques. Contrary to earlier views of discrete perception as a unitary sampling rhythm, contemporary evidence points not to one but several rhythms of perception that may depend on sensory modality, task, stimulus properties, or brain region. In vision, for example, a sensory alpha rhythm (∼10\\xa0Hz) may coexist with at least one more rhythm performing attentional sampling at around 7\\xa0Hz. How these multiple periodic functions are orchestrated, and how internal sampling rhythms coordinate with overt sampling behavior, remain open questions.', \"Novelty processing and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease: A review. The detection and processing of novelty plays a critical role in memory function. Despite this, relatively little is known about how novelty influences memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review sought to address whether AD patients are still sensitive to novelty; whether novelty triggers memory processes as is observed in healthy subjects; and whether it is possible to promote novelty to enhance memory at the different stages of AD. The studies reviewed showed that novelty processing is mostly impaired in AD patients, whereas it can be preserved under some conditions in MCI, particularly when cognitive demands are otherwise low. We further identify outstanding questions that should be addressed in the near future in order to more robustly establish the fate of novelty processing and detection in the course of AD. Doing so would allow to improve current models of memory impairment in AD, leading to a more comprehensive view of the sources of memory decline and could lead to neuropsychological and/or pharmaceutical rehabilitation programs.\", 'Deep Brain Stimulation for Depression: Is It a Gray or White “Matter”?. ', 'Cannabinoid-induced motor dysfunction via autophagy inhibition. The recreational and medical use of cannabis is largely increasing worldwide. Cannabis use, however, can cause adverse side effects, so conducting innovative studies aimed to understand and potentially reduce cannabis-evoked harms is important. Previous research conducted on cultured neural cells had supported that CNR1/CB1R (cannabinoid receptor 1), the main molecular target of cannabis, affects macroautophagy/autophagy. However, it was not known whether CNR1 controls autophagy in the brain in vivo, and, eventually, what the functional consequences of a potential CNR1-autophagy connection could be. We have now found that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major intoxicating constituent of cannabis, impairs autophagy in the mouse striatum. Administration of autophagy activators (specifically, the rapalog temsirolimus and the disaccharide trehalose) rescues THC-induced autophagy inhibition and motor dyscoordination. The combination of various genetic strategies in vivo supports the idea that CNR1 molecules located on neurons belonging to the direct (striatonigral) pathway are required for the autophagy- and motor-impairing activity of THC. By identifying autophagy as a mechanistic link between THC and motor performance, our findings may open a new conceptual view on how cannabis acts in the brain.', 'A New Tool for In Vivo Study of Astrocyte Connexin 43 in Brain. Astrocytes are glial cells organized in dynamic and structured networks in the brain. These plastic networks, involving key proteins such as connexin 43 (Cx43), are engaged in fine neuronal tuning and have recently been considered as emerging therapeutic targets in central nervous system disorders. We developed and validated a new application of the manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) technique allowing in vivo investigations of astrocyte-neuron interactions through quantification of brain Cx43 functional activity. The proof of concept has been achieved by quantification of MEMRI signals in brain after either local astrocyte-specific Cx43 knockdown with shRNA or systemic administration of Cx43 blockers. Unilateral hippocampal Cx43 genetical silencing was associated with an ipsilateral local increase of MEMRI signal. Furthermore, Cx43 blockers also enhanced MEMRI signal responses in hippocampus. Altogether, these data reveal the MEMRI technique as a tool for quantitative imaging of in vivo Cx43-dependent function in astrocytes under physiological and pathological conditions.', 'Combining brain perturbation and neuroimaging in non-human primates. Brain perturbation studies allow detailed causal inferences of behavioral and neural processes. Because the combination of brain perturbation methods and neural measurement techniques is inherently challenging, research in humans has predominantly focused on non-invasive, indirect brain perturbations, or neurological lesion studies. Non-human primates have been indispensable as a neurobiological system that is highly similar to humans while simultaneously being more experimentally tractable, allowing visualization of the functional and structural impact of systematic brain perturbation. This review considers the state of the art in non-human primate brain perturbation with a focus on approaches that can be combined with neuroimaging. We consider both non-reversible (lesions) and reversible or temporary perturbations such as electrical, pharmacological, optical, optogenetic, chemogenetic, pathway-selective, and ultrasound based interference methods. Method-specific considerations from the research and development community are offered to facilitate research in this field and support further innovations. We conclude by identifying novel avenues for further research and innovation and by highlighting the clinical translational potential of the methods.', 'Fasudil treatment in adult reverses behavioural changes and brain ventricular enlargement in Oligophrenin-1 mouse model of intellectual disability. Loss of functionmutations in human Oligophrenin1 (OPHN1) gene are responsible for syndromic intellectual disability (ID) associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and cerebral ventricles enlargement. Functional studies in rodentmodels suggest that OPHN1 linked ID is a consequence of abnormal synaptic transmission and shares common pathophysiologicalmechanisms with other cognitive disorders. Variants of this gene have been also identified in autismspectrumdisorder and schizophrenia. The advanced understanding of themechanisms underlying OPHN1-related ID, allowed us to develop a therapeutic approach targeting the Ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA) signalling pathway and repurpose Fasudil-a well-tolerated Rho Kinase (ROCK) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibitor-as a treatment of ID. We have previously shown ex-vivo its beneficial effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity in amousemodel of the OPHN1 loss of function. Here, we report that chronic treatment in adultmouse with Fasudil, is able to counteract vertical and horizontal hyperactivities, restores recognitionmemory and limits the brain ventricular dilatation observed in Ophn1-/y. However, deficits in working and spatialmemories are partially or not rescued by the treatment. These results highlight the potential of Fasudil treatment in synaptopathies and also the need for multiple therapeutic approaches especially in adult where brain plasticity is reduced.', 'What we talk about when we talk about binge drinking: Towards an integrated conceptualization and evaluation. Rationale: Binge drinking (BD), characterized by recurring alternations between intense intoxication episodes and abstinence periods, is the most frequent alcohol consumption pattern in youth and is growing in prevalence among older adults. Many studies have underlined the specific harmful impact of this habit by showing impaired abilities in a wide range of cognitive functions among binge drinkers, as well as modifications of brain structure and function. Aims: Several controversies and inconsistencies currently hamper the harmonious development of the field and the recognition of BD as a specific alcohol consumption pattern. The main concern is the absence of consensual BD conceptualization, leading to variability in experimental group selection and alcohol consumption evaluation. The present paper aims at overcoming this key issue through a two-step approach. Methods and conclusions: First, a literature review allows proposing an integrated BD conceptualization, distinguishing it from other subclinical alcohol consumption patterns. Six specific characteristics of BD are identified, namely, (1) the presence of physiological symptoms related to BD episodes, (2) the presence of psychological symptoms related to BD episodes, (3) the ratio of BD episodes compared to all alcohol drinking occasions, (4) the frequency of BD episodes, (5) the consumption speed and (6) the alternation between BD episodes and soberness periods. Second, capitalizing on this conceptual clarification, we propose an evaluation protocol jointly measuring these six BD characteristics. Finally, several research perspectives are presented to refine the proposed conceptualization.', 'Anatomical dissociation of intracerebral signals for reward and punishment prediction errors in humans. Whether maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments rely on distinct brain systems remains debated, given inconsistent results coming from human neuroimaging and animal electrophysiology studies. Bridging the gap across techniques, we recorded intracerebral activity from twenty participants while they performed an instrumental learning task. We found that both reward and punishment prediction errors (PE), estimated from computational modeling of choice behavior, correlate positively with broadband gamma activity (BGA) in several brain regions. In all cases, BGA scaled positively with the outcome (reward or punishment versus nothing) and negatively with the expectation (predictability of reward or punishment). However, reward PE were better signaled in some regions (such as the ventromedial prefrontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortex), and punishment PE in other regions (such as the anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). These regions might therefore belong to brain systems that differentially contribute to the repetition of rewarded choices and the avoidance of punished choices.', 'Effects of aging on low luminance contrast processing in humans. Luminance contrast is a fundamental visual cue. Using a dedicated neuroimaging framework, we sought to characterize typical Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses in two subcortical regions, the superior colliculus (SC) and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and V1, the primary visual cortex area, and how they change over the lifespan. For imaging subcortical activity related to luminance contrast modulation, specific measurements were introduced to rule out possible signal contamination by cardiovascular activity and vascular alterations with age that could hamper the BOLD signal interpretation. Clearly, BOLD responses increased in these three regions with luminance contrast, with a statistically significant diminution in LGN and V1 for older compared to younger participants, while basal perfusion remained unchanged. Additionally, perceptual responses, as assessed with psychophysical experiments, were highly correlated to BOLD measures in the three studied regions. Taken together, fMRI and psychophysics results indicate an alteration of luminance contrast processing with normal aging. Based on this knowledge we can better recognize when age-related brain changes vary from these expectations especially during neurodegenerative diseases progression where the functioning of subcortical structures is altered. The proposed fMRI-physchophysics methodology allows performing such investigation.', 'Impact of Brain Atrophy on Early Neurological Deterioration and Outcome in Severe Ischemic Stroke Treated by Intravenous Thrombolysis. Background: Brain atrophy has shown a protective effect on the risk of early neurological deterioration (END) related to malignant edema in patients with hemispheric infarction but could be deleterious on the outcome. Aims: We aimed to assess whether brain atrophy has an impact on the risk of END and on the outcome in severe ischemic strokes after intravenous (IV) thrombolysis. Methods: From a prospective thrombolysis registry, 137 patients who had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥15, MRI at admission, and IV thrombolysis were included. Relative cerebral volume was calculated. END was defined as a ≥2-points deterioration 72-h NIHSS and a good outcome as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months. A multiple logistic regression analysis with a stepwise backward procedure was performed. Results: END and a good outcome were observed, respectively, in 20 (14.6%) and 48 (37.5%) patients. In univariate analysis, predictors of END included age (p = 0.049), diabetes (p = 0.041), and parenchymal hemorrhage (p = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.018) was significantly associated with END. Brain atrophy was not associated with END even in subgroup analysis according to the baseline infarct size. In univariate analysis, age (p = 0.003), prestroke mRS (p = 0.002), hypertension (p = 0.006), baseline NIHSS (p = 0.002), END (p = 0.002), proximal occlusion (p = 0.006), and recanalization at 24 h (p < 0.001) were associated with a good outcome. Only baseline NIHSS (p = 0.006) was associated with a good outcome after adjustment. Conclusions: We did not find any impact of brain atrophy on the risk of END and the outcome at 3 months in severe ischemic strokes after IV thrombolysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the fetal brain at 3 Tesla: Preliminary experience from a single series. To report our preliminary experience with cerebral fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 3 Tesla (3T) scanner. We assessed feasibility, time of acquisition, and possibility to establish a diagnosis. Fifty-nine pregnant women had fetal MRI performed during the third trimester of pregnancy due to clinical or sonography concern of a central nervous system anomaly. No fetal or maternal sedation was used. The MRI protocol consisted of T2 turbo-spin-echo images in 3 planes of space. No T1-weighted images were performed. All images were analyzed by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists, who evaluated spatial resolution, artifacts, time of acquisition, and possibility to establish a diagnosis suspected by sonography. Examinations were performed safely for all patients. The images required longer time of acquisition (approximately 75 seconds for each plane in the space). The specific absorption rate was not exceeded in any fetus. Cerebral fetal MRI was normal in 22 cases. The spectrum of diagnostics included isolated ventriculomegaly, posterior fossa malformation, corpus callosum malformation, gyration anomalies, craniosynostosis, tuberous sclerosis, microcephaly, external hydrocephaly, midline arachnoid cyst, cerebral lesions, and persistent hyperplastic primitive vitreous. In our series, 3 T MRI of fetal brain was feasible and able to establish a diagnosis but required longer time of acquisition.', 'Longitudinal reproducibility of default-mode network connectivity in healthy elderly participants: A multicentric resting-state fMRI study. To date, limited data are available regarding the inter-site consistency of test-retest reproducibility of functional connectivity measurements, in particular with regard to integrity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) in elderly participants. We implemented a harmonized resting-state fMRI protocol on 13 clinical scanners at 3.0. T using vendor-provided sequences. Each site scanned a group of 5 healthy elderly participants twice, at least a week apart. We evaluated inter-site differences and test-retest reproducibility of both temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and functional connectivity measurements derived from: i) seed-based analysis (SBA) with seed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ii) group independent component analysis (ICA) separately for each site (site ICA), and iii) consortium ICA, with group ICA across the whole consortium. Despite protocol harmonization, significant and quantitatively important inter-site differences remained in the tSNR of resting-state fMRI data; these were plausibly driven by hardware and pulse sequence differences across scanners which could not be harmonized. Nevertheless, the tSNR test-retest reproducibility in the consortium was high (ICC. =. 0.81). The DMN was consistently extracted across all sites and analysis methods. While significant inter-site differences in connectivity scores were found, there were no differences in the associated test-retest error. Overall, ICA measurements were more reliable than PCC-SBA, with site ICA showing higher reproducibility than consortium ICA. Across the DMN nodes, the PCC yielded the most reliable measurements (≈. 4% test-retest error, ICC. =. 0.85), the medial frontal cortex the least reliable (≈. 12%, ICC. =. 0.82) and the lateral parietal cortices were in between (site ICA). Altogether these findings support usage of harmonized multisite studies of resting-state functional connectivity to characterize longitudinal effects in studies that assess disease progression and treatment response.', 'Comparison of strategies for monitoring and treating patients at the early phase of severe traumatic brain injury: the multicentre randomised controlled OXY-TC trial study protocol. INTRODUCTION: Intracranial hypertension is considered as an independent risk factor of mortality and neurological disabilities after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, clinical studies have demonstrated that episodes of brain ischaemia/hypoxia are common despite normalisation of intracranial pressure (ICP). This study assesses the impact on neurological outcome of guiding therapeutic strategies based on the monitoring of both brain tissue oxygenation pressure (PbtO2) and ICP during the first 5 days following severe TBI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Multicentre, open-labelled, randomised controlled superiority trial with two parallel groups in 300 patients with severe TBI. Intracerebral monitoring must be in place within the first 16\\u2009hours post-trauma. Patients are randomly assigned to the ICP group or to the ICP + PbtO2 group. The ICP group is managed according to the international guidelines to maintain ICP≤20\\u2009mm Hg. The ICP + PbtO2 group is managed to maintain PbtO2 ≥20\\u2009mm Hg in addition to the conventional optimisation of ICP. The primary outcome measure is the neurological status at 6 months as assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. Secondary outcome measures include quality-of-life assessment, mortality rate, therapeutic intensity and incidence of critical events during the first 5 days. Analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and full statistical analysis plan developed prior to database freeze. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sud-Est V (14-CHUG-48) and from the National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des produits de santé) (141\\u2009435B-31). Results will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed publications.The study was registered with ClinTrials NCT02754063 on 28 April 2016 (pre-results).', 'Reproducibility of Brain Responses: High for Speech Perception, Low for Reading Difficulties. Neuroscience findings have recently received critique on the lack of replications. To examine the reproducibility of brain indices of speech sound discrimination and their role in dyslexia, a specific reading difficulty, brain event-related potentials using EEG were measured using the same cross-linguistic passive oddball paradigm in about 200 dyslexics and 200 typically reading 8–12-year-old children from four countries with different native languages. Brain responses indexing speech and non-speech sound discrimination were extremely reproducible, supporting the validity and reliability of cognitive neuroscience methods. Significant differences between typical and dyslexic readers were found when examined separately in different country and language samples. However, reading group differences occurred at different time windows and for different stimulus types between the four countries. This finding draws attention to the limited generalizability of atypical brain response findings in children with dyslexia across language environments and raises questions about a common neurobiological factor for dyslexia. Our results thus show the robustness of neuroscience methods in general while highlighting the need for multi-sample studies in the brain research of language disorders.', 'The research agenda for trauma critical care. In this research agenda on the acute and critical care management of trauma patients, we concentrate on the major factors leading to death, namely haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In haemostasis biology, the results of randomised controlled trials have led to the therapeutic focus moving away from the augmentation of coagulation factors (such as recombinant factor VIIa) and towards fibrinogen supplementation and administration of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid. Novel diagnostic techniques need to be evaluated to determine whether an individualised precision approach is superior to current empirical practice. The timing and efficacy of platelet transfusions remain in question, while new blood products need to be developed and evaluated, including whole blood variants, lyophilised products and novel red cell storage modalities. The current cornerstones of TBI management are intracranial pressure control, maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure and avoidance of secondary insults (such as hypotension, hypoxaemia, hyperglycaemia and pyrexia). Therapeutic hypothermia and decompressive craniectomy are controversial therapies. Further research into these strategies should focus on identifying which subgroups of patients may benefit from these interventions. Prediction of the long-term outcome early after TBI remains challenging. Early magnetic resonance imaging has recently been evaluated for predicting the long-term outcome in mild and severe TBI. Novel biomarkers may also help in outcome prediction and may predict chronic neurological symptoms. For trauma in general, rehabilitation is complex and multidimensional, and the optimal timing for commencement of rehabilitation needs investigation. We propose priority areas for clinical trials in the next 10\\xa0years.', 'Is the planum temporale surface area a marker of hemispheric or regional language lateralization?. We investigated the association between the left planum temporale (PT) surface area or asymmetry and the hemispheric or regional functional asymmetries during language production and perception tasks in 287 healthy adults (BIL&GIN) who were matched for sex and handedness. The measurements of the PT surface area were performed after manually delineating the region using brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) and considering the Heschl’s gyrus (HG) duplication pattern; the measurements either included (PTtot) or did not include (PTpost) the second gyrus. A region encompassing both the PT and HG (HGPT) was also studied. Regardless of the ROI measured, 80% of the sample had a positive left minus right PT asymmetry. We first tested whether the PTtot, PTpost and HGPT surface areas in the left or right hemispheres or PT asymmetries differed in groups of individuals varying in language lateralization by assessing their hemispheric index during a sentence production minus word list production task. We then investigated the association between these different measures of the PT anatomy and the regional asymmetries measured during the task. Regardless of the anatomical definition used, we observed no correlations between the left surface areas or asymmetries and the hemispheric or regional functional asymmetries during the language production task. We then performed a similar analysis using the same sample measuring language functional lateralization during speech listening tasks (i.e., listening to sentences and lists of words). Although the hemispheric lateralization during speech listening was not correlated with the left PTtot, PTpost or HGPT surface areas or the PT asymmetries, significant positive correlations were observed between the asymmetries in these regions and the regional functional asymmetries measured in areas adjacent to the end of the Sylvian fissure while participants listened to the word lists or sentences. The PT asymmetry thus appears to be associated with the local functional asymmetries in auditory areas but is not a marker of inter-individual variability in language dominance.', 'Perspectives given by structural connectivity bridge the gap between structure and function. ', 'Advanced imaging and labelling methods to decipher brain cell organization and function. The brain is arguably the most complex organ. The branched and extended morphology of nerve cells, their subcellular complexity, the multiplicity of brain cell types as well as their intricate connectivity and the scattering properties of brain tissue present formidable challenges to the understanding of brain function. Neuroscientists have often been at the forefront of technological and methodological developments to overcome these hurdles to visualize, quantify and modify cell and network properties. Over the last few decades, the development of advanced imaging methods has revolutionized our approach to explore the brain. Super-resolution microscopy and tissue imaging approaches have recently exploded. These instrumentation-based innovations have occurred in parallel with the development of new molecular approaches to label protein targets, to evolve new biosensors and to target them to appropriate cell types or subcellular compartments. We review the latest developments for labelling and functionalizing proteins with small localization and functionalized reporters. We present how these molecular tools are combined with the development of a wide variety of imaging methods that break either the diffraction barrier or the tissue penetration depth limits. We put these developments in perspective to emphasize how they will enable step changes in our understanding of the brain.', 'A driver role for GABA metabolism in controlling stem and proliferative cell state through GHB production in glioma. Cell populations with differing proliferative, stem-like and tumorigenic states co-exist in most tumors and especially malignant gliomas. Whether metabolic variations can drive this heterogeneity by controlling dynamic changes in cell states is unknown. Metabolite profiling of human adult glioblastoma stem-like cells upon loss of their tumorigenicity revealed a switch in the catabolism of the GABA neurotransmitter toward enhanced production and secretion of its by-product GHB (4-hydroxybutyrate). This switch was driven by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) downregulation. Enhancing GHB levels via SSADH downregulation or GHB supplementation triggered cell conversion into a less aggressive phenotypic state. GHB affected adult glioblastoma cells with varying molecular profiles, along with cells from pediatric pontine gliomas. In all cell types, GHB acted by inhibiting α-ketoglutarate-dependent Ten–eleven Translocations (TET) activity, resulting in decreased levels of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine epigenetic mark. In patients, low SSADH expression was correlated with high GHB/α-ketoglutarate ratios, and distinguished weakly proliferative/differentiated glioblastoma territories from proliferative/non-differentiated territories. Our findings support an active participation of metabolic variations in the genesis of tumor heterogeneity.', 'Neurologic manifestations associated with COVID-19: a multicentre registry. Objectives: To provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurologic manifestations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective study during the French coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in March–April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurologic manifestations were eligible. Results: We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations from 46 centres in France. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (53–72) years and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in 102 patients (45.2%). The most common neurologic diseases were COVID-19–associated encephalopathy (67/222, 30.2%), acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (15/222, 6.8%). Neurologic manifestations appeared after the first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3–8) days in COVID-19–associated encephalopathy, 7 (5–10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7–18) days in acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15–28) days in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 magnetic resonance imaging (70.7%). Among patients with acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13 (22.8%) of 57 had multiterritory ischaemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16 (28.1%) of 57. Brain magnetic resonance imaging of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute nonvascular lesions in 14 (66.7%) of 21. Cerebrospinal fluid of 97 patients (43.7%) was analysed, with pleocytosis found in 18 patients (18.6%) and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result in two patients with encephalitis. The median (IQR) follow-up was 24 (17–34) days with a high short-term mortality rate (28/222, 12.6%). Conclusions: Clinical spectrum and outcomes of neurologic manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were broad and heterogeneous, suggesting different underlying pathogenic processes.', 'Pharmacological MRI to investigate the functional selectivity of 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor biased agonists. The emerging concept of “biased agonism” denotes the phenomenon whereby agonists can preferentially direct receptor signalling to specific intracellular responses among the different transduction pathways, thus potentially avoiding side effects and improving therapeutic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate biased agonism by using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI). The cerebral blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes induced by increasing doses of two serotonin 5-HT1A receptor biased agonists, NLX-112 and NLX-101, were mapped in anaesthetized rats. Although both compounds display high affinity, selectivity and agonist efficacy for 5-HT1A receptors, NLX-101 is known to preferentially activate post-synaptic receptors, whereas NLX-112 targets both pre- and post-synaptic receptors. We used several doses of agonists in order to determine if the regional selectivity of NLX-101 was dose-dependent. NLX-112 and NLX-101 induced different positive and negative hemodynamic changes patterns at equal doses. Importantly, NLX-101 had no significant effect in regions expressing pre-synaptic receptors contrary to NLX-112. NLX-112 also produced higher BOLD changes than NLX-101 in the orbital cortex, the somatosensory cortex, and the magnocellular preoptic nuclei. In other regions such as the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal thalamus, the drugs had similar effects. In terms of functional connectivity, NLX-112 induced more widespread changes than NLX-101. The present phMRI study demonstrates that two closely-related agonists display notable differences in their hemodynamic “fingerprints”. These data support the concept of biased agonism at 5-HT1A receptors and raise the prospect of identifying novel therapeutics which exhibit improved targeting of brain regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.

', 'Brain dysfunction in tubular and tubulointerstitial kidney diseases. Kidney function has two important elements: glomerular filtration and tubular function (secretion and reabsorption). A persistent decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with or without proteinuria, is diagnostic of chronic kidney disease (CKD). While glomerular injury or disease is a major cause of CKD and usually associated with proteinuria, predominant tubular injury, with or without tubulointerstitial disease, is typically non-proteinuric. CKD has been linked with cognitive impairment, but it is unclear how much this depends on a decreased GFR, altered tubular function or the presence of proteinuria. Since CKD is often accompanied by tubular and interstitial dysfunction, we explore here for the first time the potential role of the tubular and tubulointerstitial compartments in cognitive dysfunction. To help address this issue we selected a group of primary tubular diseases with preserved GFR in which to review the evidence for any association with brain dysfunction. Cognition, mood, neurosensory and motor disturbances are not well characterized in tubular diseases, possibly because they are subclinical and less prominent than other clinical manifestations. The available literature suggests that brain dysfunction in tubular and tubulointerstitial diseases is usually mild and is more often seen in disorders of water handling. Brain dysfunction may occur when severe electrolyte and water disorders in young children persist over a long period of time before the diagnosis is made. We have chosen Bartter and Gitelman syndromes and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as examples to highlight this topic. We discuss current published findings, some unanswered questions and propose topics for future research.', \"Early life stressful experiences and neuropsychiatric vulnerability: Evidences from human and animal models. The human newborn is highly dependent on parental care for its survival but also for the healthy development of its brain. A large body of literature demonstrates the impact of early life adversity, even during the prenatal period, on the adult's health. The susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases is often potentiated by early stress. If there is an agreement that a critical developmental period exists, the mechanisms underlying the long term effects of early life adversity are still poorly understood. Recent studies in animals highlight the involvement of epigenetic processes in the transmission of such vulnerabilities, notably via modifications in germ cells, which can be transmitted in the next generations.\", 'Toward model building for visual aesthetic perception. Several models of visual aesthetic perception have been proposed in recent years. Such models have drawn on investigations into the neural underpinnings of visual aesthetics, utilizing neurophysiological techniques and brain imaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography. The neural mechanisms underlying the aesthetic perception of the visual arts have been explained from the perspectives of neuropsychology, brain and cognitive science, informatics, and statistics. Although corresponding models have been constructed, the majority of these models contain elements that are difficult to be simulated or quantified using simple mathematical functions. In this review, we discuss the hypotheses, conceptions, and structures of six typical models for human aesthetic appreciation in the visual domain: the neuropsychological, information processing, mirror, quartet, and two hierarchical feed-forward layered models. Additionally, the neural foundation of aesthetic perception, appreciation, or judgement for each model is summarized. The development of a unified framework for the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the aesthetic perception of visual art and the validation of this framework via mathematical simulation is an interesting challenge in neuroaesthetics research. This review aims to provide information regarding the most promising proposals for bridging the gap between visual information processing and brain activity involved in aesthetic appreciation.', \"Post-mortem assessment in vascular dementia: Advances and aspirations. Background: Cerebrovascular lesions are a frequent finding in the elderly population. However, the impact of these lesions on cognitive performance, the prevalence of vascular dementia, and the pathophysiology behind characteristic in vivo imaging findings are subject to controversy. Moreover, there are no standardised criteria for the neuropathological assessment of cerebrovascular disease or its related lesions in human post-mortem brains, and conventional histological techniques may indeed be insufficient to fully reflect the consequences of cerebrovascular disease. Discussion: Here, we review and discuss both the neuropathological and in vivo imaging characteristics of cerebrovascular disease, prevalence rates of vascular dementia, and clinico-pathological correlations. We also discuss the frequent comorbidity of cerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease pathology, as well as the difficult and controversial issue of clinically differentiating between Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and mixed Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia. Finally, we consider additional novel approaches to complement and enhance current post-mortem assessment of cerebral human tissue. Conclusion: Elucidation of the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease, clarification of characteristic findings of in vivo imaging and knowledge about the impact of combined pathologies are needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnoses.\", \"Neurofeedback: Principles, appraisal, and outstanding issues. Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back information about some measure of their brain activity which they are instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the last 20 years, neurofeedback has been used to treat various neurological and psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts. However, in spite of a growing popularity, neurofeedback protocols typically make (often covert) assumptions on what aspects of brain activity to target, where in the brain to act and how, which have far-reaching implications for the assessment of its potential and efficacy. Here we critically examine some conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way neurofeedback's general objectives and neural targets are defined. The neural mechanisms through which neurofeedback may act at various spatial and temporal scales, and the way its efficacy is appraised are reviewed, and the extent to which neurofeedback may be used to control functional brain activity discussed. Finally, it is proposed that gauging neurofeedback's potential, as well as assessing and improving its efficacy will require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour relationships.\", \"New piperazine multi-effect drugs prevent neurofibrillary degeneration and amyloid deposition, and preserve memory in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's Disease is a devastating dementing disease involving amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, progressive and irreversible cognitive impairment. Today, only symptomatic drugs are available and therapeutic treatments, possibly acting at a multiscale level, are thus urgently needed. To that purpose, we designed multi-effects compounds by synthesizing drug candidates derived by substituting a novel N,N′-disubstituted piperazine anti-amyloid scaffold and adding acetylcholinesterase inhibition property. Two compounds were synthesized and evaluated. The most promising hybrid molecule reduces both the amyloid pathology and the Tau pathology as well as the memory impairments in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro also, the compound reduces the phosphorylation of Tau and inhibits the release of Aβ peptides while preserving the processing of other metabolites of the amyloid precursor protein. We synthetized and tested the first drug capable of ameliorating both the amyloid and Tau pathology in animal models of AD as well as preventing the major brain lesions and associated memory impairments. This work paves the way for future compound medicines against both Alzheimer's-related brain lesions development and the associated cognitive impairments.\", \"Network dynamics during the different stages of hallucinations in schizophrenia. The majority of patients with schizophrenia suffer from hallucinations. While the triple-network model, which includes the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN) and the salience network (SAL), has recently been applied to schizophrenia, how this framework could explain the emergence of hallucinations remains unclear. Therefore, complementary brain regions that have been linked to hallucinations, such as the left hippocampus, should also be considered and added to this model. Accordingly, the present study explored the effective connectivity across these four components (i.e., the quadripartite model) during the different stages of hallucinations. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia participated in a single session of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to capture hallucinatory experiences. Based on the participants' self-report of the psychosensory experiences that occurred during scanning, hallucinatory experiences were identified and divided into four stages: periods without hallucination (“OFF”), periods with hallucination (“ON”), transition periods between “OFF” and “ON”, and the extinction of the hallucinatory experience (“END”). Using stochastic dynamic causal modeling analysis, this study first confirmed that the SAL played a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN in schizophrenia. In addition, effective connectivity within the quadripartite model depended on the hallucinatory stage. In particular, “ON” periods were linked to memory-based sensory input from the hippocampus to the SAL, while “END” periods were associated with a takeover of the CEN in favor of a voluntary process. Finally, the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of these findings are critically discussed.

There is substantial experimental evidence for dysregulation of several microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MiRNAs modulate critical brain intracellular signaling pathways and are associated with AD core pathophysiological mechanisms. First, we conducted a real-time quantitative PCR-based pilot study to identify a set of brain-enriched miRNAs in a monocentric cohort of cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints, a condition associated with increased risk of AD. Second, we investigated the impact of age, sex, and the Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele, on the identified miRNA plasma concentrations. In addition, we explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of the miRNAs plasma concentrations with regional brain metabolic uptake using amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (18F-FDG-PET). We identified a set of six brain-enriched miRNAs—miRNA-125b, miRNA-146a, miRNA-15b, miRNA-148a, miRNA-26b, and miRNA-100. Age, sex, and APOE ε4 allele were not associated with individual miRNA abundance. MiRNA-15b concentrations were significantly lower in the Aβ-PET-positive compared to Aβ-PET-negative individuals. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the miRNA-15b*time interaction on regional metabolic 18F-FDG-PET uptake in the left hippocampus. Plasma miRNA-125b concentrations, as well as the miRNA-125b*time interaction (over a 2-year follow-up), were negatively associated with regional Aβ-PET standard uptake value ratio in the right anterior cingulate cortex. At baseline, we found a significantly negative association between plasma miRNA-125b concentrations and 18F-FDG-PET uptake in specific brain regions. In an asymptomatic at-risk population for AD, we show significant associations between plasma concentrations of miRNA-125b and miRNA-15b with core neuroimaging biomarkers of AD pathophysiology. Our results, coupled with existing experimental evidence, suggest a potential protective anti-Aβ effect of miRNA-15b and a biological link between miRNA-125b and Aβ-independent neurotoxic pathways.', 'White matter correlates of hemi-face dominance in happy and sad expression. The neural underpinnings of human emotional expression are thought to be unevenly distributed among the two brain hemispheres. However, little is known on the anatomy supporting this claim, particularly in the cerebral white matter. Here, we explored the relationship between hemi-face dominance in emotional expression and cerebral white matter asymmetries in 33 healthy participants. Measures of emotional expression were derived from pictures of the participant’s faces in a ‘happy smiling’ and a ‘sad frowning’ conditions. Chimeric faces were constructed by mirroring right and left hemi-faces, as done in previous studies, resulting in a left mirrored and right mirrored chimeric face per picture. To gain measures of hemi-face dominance per participant, a jury of 20 additional participants rated which chimeric face shows the higher intensity of emotional expressivity, by marking a 155\\xa0mm line between the two versions. Measures of the asymmetry of the uncinate, the cingulum and the three branches of superior longitudinal fasciculi were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging tractography dissections. Group effect analyses indicated that the degree of asymmetry in emotional expression was not as prominent as reported in the literature and showed a large inter-individual variability. The degree of asymmetry in emotional expression was, however, significantly associated with the asymmetries in connective properties of the fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal tracts, specifically the uncinate fasciculus and the first branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Therefore, this result raises novel hypotheses on the relationship of specific white matter tracts and emotional expression, especially their role in mood disorders.', 'Longitudinal study of functional brain network reorganization in clinically isolated syndrome. Background: There is a lack of longitudinal studies exploring the topological organization of functional brain networks at the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: This study aims to assess potential brain functional reorganization at rest in patients with CIS (PwCIS) after 1 year of evolution and to characterize the dynamics of functional brain networks at the early stage of the disease. Methods: We prospectively included 41 PwCIS and 19 matched healthy controls (HCs). They were scanned at baseline and after 1 year. Using graph theory, topological metrics were calculated for each region. Hub disruption index was computed for each metric. Results: Hub disruption indexes of degree and betweenness centrality were negative at baseline in patients (p < 0.05), suggesting brain reorganization. After 1 year, hub disruption indexes for degree and betweenness centrality were still negative (p < 0.00001), but such reorganization appeared more pronounced than at baseline. Different brain regions were driving these alterations. No global efficiency differences were observed between PwCIS and HCs either at baseline or at 1 year. Conclusion: Dynamic changes in functional brain networks appear at the early stages of MS and are associated with the maintenance of normal global efficiency in the brain, suggesting a compensatory effect.', 'The Hidden Spatial Dimension of Alpha: 10-Hz Perceptual Echoes Propagate as Periodic Traveling Waves in the Human Brain. EEG reverse-correlation techniques have revealed that visual information processing entails a ∼10-Hz (alpha) occipital response that reverberates sensory inputs up to 1 s. However, the spatial distribution of these perceptual echoes remains unknown: are they synchronized across the brain, or do they propagate like a traveling wave? Here, in two experiments with varying stimulus locations, we demonstrate the systematic phase propagation of perceptual echoes. A single stimulation in the upper visual field produced an “echo traveling wave” propagating from posterior to frontal sensors. The simultaneous presentation of two independent stimuli in separate visual hemifields produced two superimposed traveling waves propagating in opposite directions. Strikingly, in each sensor, the phase of the two echoes differed, with a phase advance for the contralateral stimulus. Thus, alpha traveling waves sweep across the human brain, encoding stimulus position in the phase domain, in line with the 70-year-old “cortical scanning” hypothesis (Pitts and McCulloch, 1947).', \"Microbes and Alzheimer's disease. \", 'Intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity asymmetry and its relationships with handedness and language Lateralization. Asymmetry in intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity, and its association with handedness and hemispheric dominance for language, were investigated in a sample of 290 healthy volunteers enriched in left-handers (52.7%). From the resting-state FMRI data of each participant, we derived an intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity asymmetry (HICA) matrix as the difference between the left and right intra-hemispheric matrices of intrinsic correlation computed for each pair of the AICHA atlas ROIs. We defined a similarity measure between the HICA matrices of two individuals as the correlation coefficient of their corresponding elements, and computed for each individual an index of intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity asymmetry as the average similarity measure of his HICA matrix to those of the other subjects of the sample (HICAs). Gaussian-mixture modeling of the age-corrected HICAs sample distribution revealed that two types of HICA patterns were present, one (Typical_HICA) including 92.4% of the participants while the other (Atypical_HICA) included only 7.6% of them, mostly left-handers. In addition, we investigated the relationship between asymmetry in intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity and language hemispheric dominance, including a potential effect of handedness on this relationship, thanks to an FMRI acquisition during language production from which an hemispheric functional lateralization index for language (HFLI) and a type of hemispheric dominance for language, namely leftward, ambilateral, or rightward, were derived for each individual. There was a significant association between the types of language hemispheric dominance and of intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity asymmetry, occurrence of Atypical_HICAs individuals being very high in the group of individuals rightward-lateralized for language (80%), reduced in the ambilateral group (19%) and rare in individuals leftward-lateralized for language (less than 3%). Quantitatively, we found a significant positive linear relationship between the HICAs and HFLI indices, with an effect of handedness on the intercept but not on the slope of this relationship. These findings demonstrate that handedness and hemispheric dominance for language are significantly but independently associated with the asymmetry of intra-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity. These findings suggest that asymmetry in intra-hemispheric connectivity is a variable phenotype shaped in part by hemispheric lateralization for language, but possibly also depending on other lateralized functions.', 'The association between hemispheric specialization for language production and for spatial attention depends on left-hand preference strength. Cerebral lateralization for language production and spatial attention and their relationships with manual preference strength (MPS) were assessed in a sample of 293 healthy volunteers, including 151 left-handers, using fMRI during covert sentence production (PROD) and line bisection judgment (LBJ) tasks, as compared to high- and low-level reference tasks. At the group level, we found the expected complementary hemispheric specialization (HS) with leftward asymmetries for PROD within frontal and temporal regions and rightward asymmetries for LBJ within frontal and posterior occipito–parieto-temporal regions. Individual hemispheric (HLI) and regional (frontal and occipital) lateralization indices (LI) were then calculated on the activation maps for PROD and LBJ. We found a correlation between the degree of rightward cerebral asymmetry and the leftward behavioral attentional bias recorded during LBJ task. This correlation was found when LBJ-LI was computed over the hemispheres, in the frontal lobes, but not in the occipital lobes. We then investigated whether language production and spatial attention cerebral lateralization relate to each other, and whether manual preference was a variable that impacted the complementary HS of these functions. No correlation was found between spatial and language LIs in the majority of our sample of participants, including right-handers with a strong right-hand preference (sRH, n=97) and mixed-handers (MH, n=97), indicating that these functions lateralized independently. By contrast, in the group of left-handers with a strong left-hand preference (sLH, n= 99), a negative correlation was found between language and spatial lateralization. This negative correlation was found when LBJ-LI and PROD-LI were computed over the hemispheres, in the frontal lobes and between the occipital lobes for LBJ and the frontal lobes for PROD. These findings underline the importance to include sLH in the study sample to reveal the underlying mechanisms of complementary HS.', 'Endovascular Treatment Decision Making in Octogenarians and Nonagenarians: Insights from UNMASK EVT an International Multidisciplinary Study. Background: Evidence for efficacy and safety in stroke patients ≥80\\xa0years is limited, since they were underrepresented in randomized thrombectomy trials. This study sought to explore how physicians approach endovascular therapy (EVT) decision making in octogenarians and nonagenarians under their current local resources under assumed ideal conditions, i.e. without external (monetary or infrastructural) limitations. Methods: In an international multidisciplinary survey, 607 physicians involved in acute stroke care were randomly assigned 10 out of a\\xa0pool of 22\\xa0case scenarios with different evidence levels for EVT, 4 of which involved octogenarians and 2 nonagenarians, and asked how they would treat the patient in the given scenario A)\\xa0under their current local resources and B)\\xa0under assumed ideal conditions, i.e. with no external restraints. Decision rates were calculated and clustered multivariable regression analysis performed to determine adjusted measures of effect size for patient age. Results: In octogenarians, physicians decided in favor of EVT in 76.7% (all of which were level\\xa02B evidence scenarios) under current local resources and in 80.2% under assumed ideal conditions. In nonagenarians, 74.0% decided in favor of EVT under current local resources (level\\xa01A scenarios: 87.7%, level\\xa02B scenarios: 60.3%) and 79.2% would offer EVT under assumed ideal conditions (level\\xa01A scenarios: 91.3%, level\\xa02B scenarios: 67.2%). Age was not a\\xa0significant predictor for treatment decision under current local resources (adjusted odds ratio, OR: 0.99, confidence interval, CI: 0.96–1.02 per decile increase) and under assumed ideal conditions (adjusted OR: 1.00, CI 0.97–1.03 per decile increase). Conclusion: The vast majority of physicians participating in this survey would offer EVT to acute ischemic stroke patients above 80\\xa0years.', \"12/20 L'hémorragie sous-arachnoïdienne non traumatique. \", \"Bidirectional gut-to-brain and brain-to-gut propagation of synucleinopathy in non-human primates. In Parkinson's disease, synucleinopathy is hypothesized to spread from the enteric nervous system, via the vagus nerve, to the CNS. Here, we compare, in baboon monkeys, the pathological consequences of either intrastriatal or enteric injection of α-synucleincontaining Lewy body extracts from patients with Parkinson's disease. This study shows that patient-derived a-synuclein aggregates are able to induce nigrostriatal lesions and enteric nervous system pathology after either enteric or striatal injection in a non-human primate model. This finding suggests that the progression of α-synuclein pathology might be either caudo-rostral or rostro-caudal, varying between patients and disease subtypes. In addition, we report that α-synuclein pathological lesions were not found in the vagal nerve in our experimental setting. This study does not support the hypothesis of a transmission of α-synuclein pathology through the vagus nerve and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Instead, our results suggest a possible systemic mechanism in which the general circulation would act as a route for long-distance bidirectional transmission of endogenous α-synuclein between the enteric and the central nervous systems. Taken together, our study provides invaluable primate data exploring the role of the gut-brain axis in the initiation and propagation of Parkinson's disease pathology and should open the door to the development and testing of new therapeutic approaches aimed at interfering with the development of sporadic Parkinson's disease.\", 'N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivates reduce neuroinflammation during aging. Aging is associated to cognitive decline, which can lead to loss of life quality, personal suffering, and ultimately neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is one of the mechanisms explaining the loss of cognitive functions. Indeed, aging is associated to the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, which can be targeted by specific nutrients with anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are particularly attractive as they are present in the brain, possess immunomodulatory properties, and are precursors of lipid derivates named specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM). SPMs are crucially involved in the resolution of inflammation that is modified during aging, resulting in chronic inflammation. In this review, we first examine the effect of aging on neuroinflammation and then evaluate the potential beneficial effect of n-3 PUFA as precursors of bioactive derivates, particularly during aging, on the resolution of inflammation. Lastly, we highlight evidence supporting a role of n-3 PUFA during aging.', 'Early loss of Scribble affects cortical development, interhemispheric connectivity and psychomotor\\xa0activity. Neurodevelopmental disorders arise from combined defects in processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and commissure formation. The evolutionarily conserved tumor-suppressor protein Scribble (Scrib) serves as a nexus to transduce signals for the establishment of apicobasal and planar cell polarity during these processes. Human SCRIB gene mutations are associated with neural tube defects and this gene is located in the minimal critical region deleted in the rare Verheij syndrome. In this study, we generated brain-specific conditional cKO mouse mutants and assessed the impact of the Scrib deletion on brain morphogenesis and behavior. We showed that embryonic deletion of Scrib in the telencephalon leads to cortical thickness reduction (microcephaly) and partial corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure agenesis. We correlated these phenotypes with a disruption in various developmental mechanisms of corticogenesis including neurogenesis, neuronal migration and axonal connectivity. Finally, we show that Scrib cKO mice have psychomotor deficits such as locomotor activity impairment and memory alterations. Altogether, our results show that Scrib is essential for early brain development due to its role in several developmental cellular mechanisms that could underlie some of the deficits observed in complex neurodevelopmental pathologies.', 'Acetylated tau inhibits chaperone-mediated autophagy and promotes tau pathology propagation in mice. Disrupted homeostasis of the microtubule binding protein tau is a shared feature of a set of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Acetylation of soluble tau is an early pathological event in neurodegeneration. In this work, we find that a large fraction of neuronal tau is degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) whereas, upon acetylation, tau is preferentially degraded by macroautophagy and endosomal microautophagy. Rerouting of acetylated tau to these other autophagic pathways originates, in part, from the inhibitory effect that acetylated tau exerts on CMA and results in its extracellular release. In fact, experimental blockage of CMA enhances cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic tau in a mouse model of tauopathy. Furthermore, analysis of lysosomes isolated from brains of patients with tauopathies demonstrates similar molecular mechanisms leading to CMA dysfunction. This study reveals that CMA failure in tauopathy brains alters tau homeostasis and could contribute to aggravate disease progression.', 'Close follow-up after discontinuation of cyproterone acetate: A possible option to defer surgery in patients with voluminous intracranial meningioma. ', 'The multiple neural networks of familiarity: A meta-analysis of functional imaging studies. Recent research has demonstrated the critical role of the feeling of familiarity in recognition memory. Various neuroimaging paradigms have been developed to identify the brain regions that sustain the processing of familiarity; however, there is still considerable controversy about the functional significance of each brain region implicated in familiarity-based retrieval. Here, we focused on the differences between paradigms that assess familiarity, with or without the encoding phase. We used the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm to conduct a whole-brain meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies that involved a familiarity task. Sixty-nine studies, performed in healthy subjects to determine the specific functions of the identified regions in familiarity processing, were finally selected. Distinct subanalyses were performed according to the experimental procedures used in the original studies. The ALE clusters that were highlighted revealed common activations for paradigms with and without encoding in the prefrontal cortex and in the parietal cortex. Additionally, supplementary activations related to specific familiarity (i.e., without the encoding phase) were observed in the limbic system (i.e., the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and insula) and in the associative sensory areas. The differences in the reported findings for different procedures are possibly due to differences in the concept of familiarity. To aid the exploration of the neural correlates of familiarity in future studies, the strengths and weaknesses of these experimental procedures are critically discussed.', \"Cerebral Hypoperfusion and Hypometabolism Detected by Arterial Spin Labeling MRI and FDG-PET in Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is frequently associated with atypical clinical presentations and its early detection remains a challenging issue. In this study, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL), a noninvasive perfusion MRI sequence, and [18F]-FDG-PET to detect the perfusion and metabolic features in patients with EOAD. METHODS: All patients were investigated in the French reference center for young-onset dementia and were assessed by MRI, including a pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, and [18F]-FDG-PET. Quantitative analyses and intermodality comparison with correlation analysis were made after data processing including correction of partial volume effects, cortical projection, and specific intensity normalization. RESULTS: We prospectively included 37 patients with EOAD with a mean age of 58.3 years. The areas of most severe hypoperfusion detected with ASL were located in the parietal lobes, the precuneus, the right posterior cingulate cortex, and the frontal lobes (P < .05). The areas of lowest glucose metabolism detected by [18F]-FDG-PET were identified in the temporoparietal cortex and the precuneus (P < .05). Hypometabolic regions were more extensive than hypoperfused regions on ASL maps whereas ASL highlighted alterations in the frontal lobes without apparent hypometabolism on [18F]-FDG-PET maps. CONCLUSIONS: ASL and [18F]-FDG-PET detected pathological areas of similar distribution mainly located in the inferior parietal lobules and local zones in the temporal cortex in patients with EOAD. Our preliminary study showed that ASL and [18F]-FDG-PET may have a complementary role in combination with structural MRI for the assessment of suspected EOAD.\", 'The CB1 Receptor as the Cornerstone of Exostasis. The type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is the main effector of the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is\\xa0involved in most brain and body functions. In this Perspective, we provide evidence indicating that CB1 receptor functions are key determinants of bodily coordinated exostatic processes. First, we will introduce the concepts of endostasis and exostasis as compensation or accumulation for immediate or future energy needs and discuss how exostasis has been necessary for the survival of species during evolution. Then, we will argue how different specific biological functions of the CB1 receptor in the body converge to provide physiological exostatic processes. Finally, we will introduce the concept of proactive evolution-induced diseases (PEIDs), which helps explain the seeming paradox that an evolutionary-selected physiological function can become the cause of epidemic pathological conditions, such as obesity. We propose here a possible unifying theory of CB1 receptor functions that can be tested by future experimental studies.', 'Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation alters perfusion of white matter-rich regions without altering flow in brain-irrigating arteries: Relationship to blood-brain barrier breakdown?. To better understand brain dysfunction during sepsis, cerebral arterial blood flow was assessed with Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging, perfusion with Arterial Spin Labeling and structure with diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging in rats after intraperitoneal administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Although cerebral arterial flow was not altered, perfusion of the corpus callosum region and diffusion parallel to its fibers were higher after lipopolysaccharide administration as compared to saline injection. In parallel, lipopolysaccharide induced perivascular immunoglobulin-immunoreactivity in white matter. These findings indicate that systemic inflammation can result in increased perfusion, blood-brain barrier breakdown and altered water diffusion in white matter.', 'Tetrahydrobiopterin administration facilitates amphetamine-induced dopamine release and motivation in mice. Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter involved in motivational processes. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Decreases in BH4 levels are observed in several DA-related neuropsychiatric diseases involving impairment in motivation. Yet, whether BH4 could be used to treat motivational deficits has not been comprehensively investigated. To investigate the effects of exogenous BH4 administration on the dopaminergic system and related behaviors, we acutely injected mice with BH4 (50 mg/kg). Passage of BH4 through the blood brain barrier and accumulation in brain was measured using the in situ brain perfusion technique. DA release was then recorded using in-vivo micro-dialysis and motivation was evaluated through operant conditioning paradigms in basal condition and after an amphetamine (AMPH) injection. First, we showed that BH4 crosses the blood-brain barrier and that an acute peripheral injection of BH4 is sufficient to increase the concentrations of biopterins in the brain, without affecting BH4- and DA-related protein expression. Second, we report that this increase in BH4 enhanced AMPH-stimulated DA release in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, we found that BH4-induced DA release led to improved performance of a motivational task. Altogether, these findings suggest that BH4, through its action on the dopaminergic tone, could be used as a motivational enhancer.', 'Cannabinoid control of olfactory processes: The where matters. Olfaction has a direct influence on behavior and cognitive processes. There are different neuromodulatory systems in olfactory circuits that control the sensory information flowing through the rest of the brain. The presence of the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor, (the main cannabinoid receptor in the brain), has been shown for more than 20 years in different brain olfactory areas. However, only over the last decade have we started to know the specific cellular mechanisms that link cannabinoid signaling to olfactory processing and the control of behavior. In this review, we aim to summarize and discuss our current knowledge about the presence of CB1 receptors, and the function of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of different olfactory brain circuits and related behaviors.', 'Structural brain disconnectivity mapping of post-stroke fatigue. Stroke patients commonly suffer from post stroke fatigue (PSF). Despite a general consensus that brain perturbations constitute a precipitating event in the multifactorial etiology of PSF, the specific predictive value of conventional lesion characteristics such as size and localization remains unclear. The current study represents a novel approach to assess the neural correlates of PSF in chronic stroke patients. While previous research has focused primarily on lesion location or size, with mixed or inconclusive results, we targeted the extended structural network implicated by the lesion, and evaluated the added explanatory value of a structural disconnectivity approach with regards to the brain correlates of PSF. To this end, we estimated individual structural brain disconnectome maps in 84 S survivors in the chronic phase (≥3 months post stroke) using information about lesion location and normative white matter pathways obtained from 170 healthy individuals. PSF was measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Voxel wise analyses using non-parametric permutation-based inference were conducted on disconnectome maps to estimate regional effects of disconnectivity. Associations between PSF and global disconnectivity and clinical lesion characteristics were tested by linear models, and we estimated Bayes factor to quantify the evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. The results revealed no significant associations between PSF and disconnectome measures or lesion characteristics, with moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. These results suggest that symptoms of post-stroke fatigue among chronic stroke patients are not simply explained by lesion characteristics or the extent and distribution of structural brain disconnectome, and are discussed in light of methodological considerations.', 'High-dose acyclovir combined with foscavir (foscarnet) in the management of severe herpes simplex virus meningoencephalitis.

Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) mutations have been identified in epilepsy in females with mental retardation as well as patients with a “Dravet-like” phenotype. We aimed to elucidate the electroclinical phenotype associated with PCDH19 mutation, which is currently difficult to identify at onset leading to a delay in diagnosis. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and EEG data for 13 consecutive patients with PCDH19 mutations or deletions diagnosed at our centers from 2009 to 2011, and followed these patients into adolescence and adulthood. Results. We identified a specific temporal sequence of electroclinical manifestations, identified as three main stages. During the first two years of life, previously healthy girls presented with clusters of afebrile focal seizures. Early seizures were recorded on video-EEG in 10/13 patients, and were focal (n=8) with temporo-occipital and frontal onset. Three patients with strictly stereotyped focal seizures underwent a pre-surgical work-up. Two patients started with generalized seizures, one presenting with early-onset atypical absences and the other generalized tonic-clonic seizures. During the course of the disease, from two to 10 years, seizures became fever-sensitive and continued to recur in clusters, although these were less frequent. Seizures were mainly described by eyewitnesses as generalized tonic-clonic, even though three of five seizures, recorded on EEG, showed a focal onset with fast bilateral spread. Atypical absences and fever-induced tonic-clonic seizures remained frequent in only one patient until the age of 16 years. No specific treatment or combination appeared to be more effective over another. Various degrees of cognitive or behavioural impairment were reported for all patients, but it was in the second decade that behavioural disturbances prevailed with hetero-aggressiveness and behaviour associated with frontal lobe abnormalities leading to psychosis in two. Conclusions. Early recognition of the above features should improve early diagnosis and long-term management of patients with epilepsy and PCDH19 mutations.', 'Altered signal intensity of active enhancing inflammatory lesions using post-contrast double inversion recovery MR sequence. Objectives: We aimed at establishing the impact upon gadolinium administration on the conspicuity of active enhancing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using\\xa0double inversion recovery (DIR) at 3T. Methods: 15 consecutive patients with MS (n=8) or a clinically isolated syndrome (n=7) underwent pre and post-contrast DIR in addition to T2-weighted, FLAIR, pre and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences. First, two neuroradiologists located and marked all the enhancing MS lesions visible in consensus. Second, two other neuroradiologists, blinded to other sequences than DIR, independently assessed the SI changes from pre to post-contrast DIR images for each enhancing lesion, according to a 4-point-scale: increased SI (grade 1), absence of change (grade 2), lesion being partially (grade 3) or completely masked on post-contrast DIR images (grade 4). Results: 246 MS lesions were detected including 26 enhancing on post-contrast T1-weighted images in 9 patients. The two blinded readers concluded to a decreased signal-intensity on post-contrast DIR images for all the 26 enhancing MS lesions (14 of grade 3 and 12 of grade 4). Inter-observer agreement was excellent, Kappa=0.85 (0.75 - 0.94). Using DIR post-contrast leads to altered signal-intensity of enhancing active MS lesions, ranging from partial to complete signal-loss. Conclusion: Our study strongly suggests the use of DIR before gadolinium administration. Key Points: • DIR has gained widespread use in MS. • MRI protocols for MS patients usually contain several post-contrast sequences. • Signal-intensity of enhancing MS lesions is altered using DIR post-contrast. • Our study strongly suggests the use of DIR before gadolinium administration.', 'Intraoperative MRI for the management of brain lesions adjacent to eloquent areas. Background The aim of our study was to report the usefulness of intraoperative MRI guidance in the resection of brain lesions adjacent to eloquent areas. Patients and methods A single center prospective series of gliomas amenable to optimized resection with intraoperative MRI between September 2014 and December 2015. Results The study included 56 patients. The median duration of the first intraoperative MRI was 38\\xa0min, interquartile range (IQR 30–46). Fourteen patients (40%) underwent a second intraoperative MRI, which had a median duration of 26\\xa0min (IQR, 18–30). The median total operative time was 265\\xa0min (IQR, 242–337). After the first intraoperative MRI, the median residual glioma volume of the 35 gliomas adjacent to eloquent areas was 7.04\\xa0cm3 (IQR, 2.22–13.8), which did not significantly differ from the other gliomas (P\\xa0=\\xa00.07). After the second intraoperative MRI, the median residual glioma volume was 3.86\\xa0cm3 (IQR, 0.82–6.99), which did not significantly differ from the other patients (P\\xa0=\\xa00.700). On the postoperative MRI, the median extent of the glioma resections adjacent to eloquent areas was 99.78% (IQR, 88.9–100), which was not significantly different from the rest of the population (P\\xa0=\\xa00.290). At 6 months after surgery, the median Karnofsky Performance Score was 90, and 2.8% of the patients presented a permanent new neurological deficit. Conclusion Our results suggest that intraoperative MRI is an effective and safe technique to improve the extent of brain lesion resections close to eloquent areas.', 'Anatomical and functional abnormalities on MRI in kabuki syndrome. Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder (1/32000 births) characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, short stature, and dermatoglyphic and skeletal abnormalities. In the last decade, mutations in KMT2D and KDM6A were identified as a major cause of kabuki syndrome. Although genetic abnormalities have been highlighted in KS, brain abnormalities have been little explored. Here, we have investigated brain abnormalities in 6 patients with KS (4 males; M age = 10.96 years, SD = 2.97 years) with KMT2D mutation in comparison with 26 healthy controls (17 males; M age = 10.31 years, SD = 2.96 years). We have used MRI to explore anatomical and functional brain abnormalities in patients with KS. Anatomical abnormalities in grey matter volume were assessed by cortical and subcortical analyses. Functional abnormalities were assessed by comparing rest cerebral blood flow measured with arterial spin labeling-MRI. When compared to healthy controls, KS patients had anatomical alterations characterized by grey matter decrease localized in the bilateral precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. In addition, KS patients also presented functional alterations characterized by cerebral blood flow decrease in the left precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, subcortical analyses revealed significantly decreased grey matter volume in the bilateral hippocampus and dentate gyrus in patients with KS. Our results strongly indicate anatomical and functional brain abnormalities in KS. They suggest a possible neural basis of the cognitive symptoms observed in KS, such as fine motor impairment, and indicate the need to further explore the consequences of such brain abnormalities in this disorder. Finally, our results encourage further imaging-genetics studies investigating the link between genetics, anatomical and functional brain alterations in KS.', 'Cross-sectional and longitudinal interaction effects of physical activity and APOE-ε4 on white matter integrity in older adults: The MAPT study. Background: Physical activity (PA) has been shown to modulate the detrimental effect of carrying the apolipoprotein-E epsilon 4 (APOE-ɛ4) allele on brain structure. However, the current literature mainly provides cross-sectional data, and longitudinal studies investigating the interaction between genotype and PA on white matter (WM) integrity are lacking. Objectives: We investigated both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal interactive effects of APOE-ɛ4 and PA on WM integrity in older adults. Methods: Fractional anisotropy, as well as axial, radial, and mean diffusivity, extracted from brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to assess WM integrity in non-demented older adults. They were categorized according to their APOE-ɛ4 status (carriers vs. non-carriers), and their level of total (TPA), moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and light (LPA) PA were assessed using a questionnaire. Mixed model regressions were performed to test the interactive effects of APOE-ɛ4 status and PA on WM integrity at baseline and over a 3-year follow-up. Results: 190 subjects with a mean age 74.5 years (SD = 3.9) were examined. Despite a lack of cross-sectional associations, sensitivity analyses revealed that, in the carrier group only, higher levels of LPA, but not MVPA, were mainly associated with higher axial and mean diffusivity values over time. Conclusions: This study partially confirms the previously reported interactive associations between PA, APOE-ɛ4 genotype and WM integrity, supporting the hypothesis that PA may protect against fiber loss in WM tracts containing crossing fibers. Future studies assessing sedentary behaviors in addition to PA could bring relevant contributions to the field.

CALHM1 is a cell surface calcium channel expressed in cerebral neurons. CALHM1 function in the brain remains unknown, but recent results showed that neuronal CALHM1 controls intracellular calcium signaling and cell excitability, two mechanisms required for synaptic function. Here, we describe the generation of Calhm1 knockout (Calhm1 -/-) mice and investigate CALHM1 role in neuronal and cognitive functions. Structural analysis revealed that Calhm1 -/- brains had normal regional and cellular architecture, and showed no evidence of neuronal or synaptic loss, indicating that CALHM1 deficiency does not affect brain development or brain integrity in adulthood. However, Calhm1 -/- mice showed a severe impairment in memory flexibility, assessed in the Morris water maze, and a significant disruption of long-term potentiation without alteration of long-term depression, measured in ex vivo hippocampal slices. Importantly, in primary neurons and hippocampal slices, CALHM1 activation facilitated the phosphorylation of NMDA and AMPA receptors by protein kinase A. Furthermore, neuronal CALHM1 activation potentiated the effect of glutamate on the expression of c-Fos and C/EBPβ, two immediate-early gene markers of neuronal activity. Thus, CALHM1 controls synaptic activity in cerebral neurons and is required for the flexible processing of memory in mice. These results shed light on CALHM1 physiology in the mammalian brain.', 'Effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy in a patient with radiation-induced brain injuries. ', 'The central vein sign in multiple sclerosis patients with vascular comorbidities. Background: The central vein sign (CVS) is an imaging biomarker able to differentiate multiple sclerosis (MS) from other conditions causing similar appearance lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). However, the impact of vascular risk factors (VRFs) for CSVD on the percentage of CVS positive (CVS+) lesions in MS has never been evaluated. Objective: To investigate the association between different VRFs and the percentage of CVS+ lesions in MS. Methods: In 50 MS patients, 3T brain MRIs (including high-resolution 3-dimensional T2*-weighted images) were analyzed for the presence of the CVS and MRI markers of CSVD. A backward stepwise regression model was used to predict the combined predictive effect of VRF (i.e. age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, ever-smoking, and hypercholesterolemia) and MRI markers of CSVD on the CVS. Results: The median frequency of CVS+ lesions was 71% (range: 35%–100%). In univariate analysis, age (p < 0.0001), hypertension (p < 0.001), diabetes (p < 0.01), obesity (p < 0.01), smoking (p < 0.05), and the presence of enlarged-perivascular-spaces on MRI (p < 0.005) were all associated with a lower percentage of CVS+ lesions. The stepwise regression model showed that age and arterial hypertension were both associated with the percentage of CVS+ lesions in MS (adjusted R2 = 0.46; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: The proportion of CVS+ lesions significantly decreases in older and hypertensive MS patients. Although this study was conducted in patients with an already established MS diagnosis, the diagnostic yield of the previously proposed 35% CVS proportion-based diagnostic threshold appears to be not affected. Overall these results suggest that the presence of VRF for CSVD should be taken into account during the CVS assessment.', 'Muscle and cerebral oxygenation during exercise in athletes with exercise-induced hypoxemia: A comparison between sea level and acute moderate hypoxia. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of exercise-induced hypoxemia (EIH) on muscle and cerebral oxygenation responses during maximal exercise in normoxia and in acute moderate hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen: 15.3%, 2400 m). EIH was defined as a drop in hemoglobin saturation of at least 4% for at least three consecutive minutes during maximal exercise at sea level. Twenty-five athletes performed incremental treadmill tests to assess maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) in normoxia and in hypoxia. Oxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle and the left prefrontal cortex of the brain was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. During the normoxic test, 15 athletes exhibited EIH; they displayed a larger change in muscle levels of oxyhemoglobin (ΔO2Hb) (p = 0.04) and a greater change in cerebral levels of deoxyhemoglobin (ΔHHb) (p = 0.02) than athletes without EIH (NEIH group). During the hypoxic test, muscle ΔO2Hb was lower in the EIH group than in the NEIH group (p = 0.03). At VO2max, hypoxia was associated with a smaller cerebral ΔO2Hb in both groups, and a greater cerebral ΔHHb compared to normoxia in the NEIH group only (p = 0.02). No intergroup differences in changes in muscle oxygenation were observed. The severity of O2 arterial desaturation was negatively correlated with changes in total muscle hemoglobin in normoxia (r = −0.48, p = 0.01), and positively correlated with the cerebral ΔHHb in normoxia (r = 0.45, p = 0.02). The occurrence of EIH at sea level was associated with specific muscle and cerebral oxygenation responses to exercise under both normoxia and moderate hypoxia.', \"Predicting and Characterizing Neurodegenerative Subtypes with Multimodal Neurocognitive Signatures of Social and Cognitive Processes. Background: Social cognition is critically compromised across neurodegenerative diseases, including the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no previous study has used social cognition and other cognitive tasks to predict diagnoses of these conditions, let alone reporting the brain correlates of prediction outcomes. Objective: We performed a diagnostic classification analysis using social cognition, cognitive screening (CS), and executive function (EF) measures, and explored which anatomical and functional networks were associated with main predictors. Methods: Multiple group discriminant function analyses (MDAs) and ROC analyses of social cognition (facial emotional recognition, theory of mind), CS, and EF were implemented in 223 participants (bvFTD, AD, PD, controls). Gray matter volume and functional connectivity correlates of top discriminant scores were investigated. Results: Although all patient groups revealed deficits in social cognition, CS, and EF, our classification approach provided robust discriminatory characterizations. Regarding controls, probabilistic social cognition outcomes provided the best characterization for bvFTD (together with CS) and PD, but not AD (for which CS alone was the best predictor). Within patient groups, the best MDA probabilities scores yielded high classification rates for bvFTD versus PD (98.3%, social cognition), AD versus PD (98.6%, social cognition+CS), and bvFTD versus AD (71.7%, social cognition+CS). Top MDA scores were associated with specific patterns of atrophy and functional networks across neurodegenerative conditions. Conclusion: Standardized validated measures of social cognition, in combination with CS, can provide a dimensional classification with specific pathophysiological markers of neurodegeneration diagnoses.\", 'Early development of symptomatic drugs in AD: A systematic review of the use of biomarkers. Pharmacological therapies currently marketed for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are only symptomatic and show limited effects in terms of clinical benefit. Thus, the development of new symptomatic drugs remains essential. However the dramatic increase in costs associated with drug development together with the poor number of emerging drugs highlights how crucial it is to accelerate the findings aiming to bringing new drugs to market. In this respect, optimization of the development process by integrating, at early stage, reliable biomarkers able to predict clinical benefit in phase III clinical trials may help. The improvement of certain techniques such as imaging and electrophysiological methods has led to a more accurate assessment of the brain’s physiological impact of pharmacological treatments used to alleviate symptoms in AD patients. This review aims to gather the main findings from clinical studies where the effect of anti-dementia drugs were assessed in healthy volunteers and AD patients through one or several such biomarkers (electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)). Overall, evidence presented in this review suggests that various biomarkers associated with key impairments observed in AD were sensitive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) medication and memantine with a good correlation with enhancement of cognitive performance. In most of the reviewed studies, only one kind of biomarker was used. Among these, deficits in quantitative EEG profile, P300 latency, and regional brain activity measured by either functional MRI (fMRI) during face encoding and working memory task or by PET/SPECT have been shown to be reversed by anti-dementia drugs. It is therefore suggested that a single biomarker approach would be limited and not be sufficiently predictive to extensively assess the potential of a new symptomatic drug. Hence, it appears that a combination approach with the use of a panel of biomarkers rather than a single biomarker may be more appropriate to establish a good correlation between the disease and therapeutic intervention.', \"Functional imaging correlates of akinesia in Parkinson's disease: Still open issues. Akinesia is a major manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) related to difficulties or failures of willed movement to occur. Akinesia is still poorly understood and is not fully alleviated by standard therapeutic strategies. One reason is that the area of the clinical concept has blurred boundaries referring to confounded motor symptoms. Here, we review neuroimaging studies which, by providing access to finer-grained mechanisms, have the potential to reveal the dysfunctional brain processes that account for akinesia. It comes out that no clear common denominator could be identified across studies that are too heterogeneous with respect to the clinical/theoretical concepts and methods used. Results reveal, however, that various abnormalities within but also outside the motor and dopaminergic pathways might be associated with akinesia in PD patients. Notably, numerous yet poorly reproducible neural correlates were found in different brain regions supporting executive control by means of resting-state or task-based studies. This includes for instance the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex or the precuneus. This observation raises the issue of the multidimensional nature of akinesia. Yet, other open issues should be considered conjointly to drive future investigations. Above all, a unified terminology is needed to allow appropriate association of behavioral symptoms with brain mechanisms across studies. We adhere to a use of the term akinesia restricted to dysfunctions of movement initiation, ranging from delayed response to freezing or even total abolition of movement. We also call for targeting more specific neural mechanisms of movement preparation and action triggering with more sophisticated behavioral designs/event-related neurofunctional analyses. More work is needed to provide reliable evidence, but answering these still open issues might open up new prospects, beyond dopaminergic therapy, for managing this disabling symptom.\", 'Multiple systems in macaques for tracking prediction errors and other types of surprise. Animals learn from the past to make predictions. These predictions are adjusted after prediction errors (PEs), i.e., after surprising events. Generally, most reward PE models learn the average expected amount of reward. However, here we demonstrate the existence of distinct mechanisms for detecting other types of surprising events. Six macaques learned to respond to visual stimuli to receive varying amounts of juice rewards. Most trials ended with the delivery of either 1 or 3 juice drops so that animals learned to expect 2 juice drops on average even though instances of precisely 2 drops were rare. To encourage learning, we also included sessions during which the ratio between 1 and 3 drops changed. Additionally, in all sessions, the stimulus sometimes appeared in an unexpected location. Thus, 3 types of surprising events could occur: Reward amount surprise (i.e., a scalar reward prediction error), rare reward surprise, and visuospatial surprise. Importantly, we can dissociate scalar reward prediction errors-rewards that deviated from the average reward amount expected-and rare reward events-rewards that accorded with the average reward expectation but that rarely occurred. We linked each type of surprise to a distinct pattern of neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Activity in the vicinity of the dopaminergic midbrain only reflected surprise about the amount of reward. Lateral prefrontal cortex had a more general role in detecting surprising events. Posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex specifically detected RREs regardless of whether they followed average reward amount expectations, but only in learnable reward environments.', 'Tensorpac: An open-source Python toolbox for tensor-based phase-amplitude coupling measurement in electrophysiological brain signals. Despite being the focus of a thriving field of research, the biological mechanisms that underlie information integration in the brain are not yet fully understood. A theory that has gained a lot of traction in recent years suggests that multi-scale integration is regulated by a hierarchy of mutually interacting neural oscillations. In particular, there is accumulating evidence that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a specific form of cross-frequency interaction, plays a key role in numerous cognitive processes. Current research in the field is not only hampered by the absence of a gold standard for PAC analysis, but also by the computational costs of running exhaustive computations on large and high-dimensional electrophysiological brain signals. In addition, various signal properties and analyses parameters can lead to spurious PAC. Here, we present Tensorpac, an open-source Python toolbox dedicated to PAC analysis of neurophysiological data. The advantages of Tensorpac include (1) higher computational efficiency thanks to software design that combines tensor computations and parallel computing, (2) the implementation of all most widely used PAC methods in one package, (3) the statistical analysis of PAC measures, and (4) extended PAC visualization capabilities. Tensorpac is distributed under a BSD-3-Clause license and can be launched on any operating system (Linux, OSX and Windows). It can be installed directly via pip or downloaded from Github (https://github.com/EtienneCmb/tensorpac). By making Tensorpac available, we aim to enhance the reproducibility and quality of PAC research, and provide open tools that will accelerate future method development in neuroscience.', \"Neuroimaging Correlates of Frontotemporal Dementia Associated with SQSTM1 Mutations. Background: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a progressive dementia characterized by focal atrophy of frontal and/or temporal lobes caused by mutations in the gene coding for sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), among other genes. Rare SQSTM1 gene mutations have been associated with Paget's disease of bone, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and, more recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Objective: The aim of the study was to determine whether a characteristic pattern of grey and white matter loss is associated with SQSTM1 dysfunction. Methods: We performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study in FTD subjects carrying SQSTM1 pathogenic variants (FTD/SQSTM1 mutation carriers; n=10), compared with FTD subjects not carrying SQSTM1 mutations (Sporadic FTD; n=20) and healthy controls with no SQSTM1 mutations (HC/SQSTM1 noncarriers; n=20). The groups were matched according to current age, disease duration, and gender. Results: After comparing FTD/SQSTM1 carriers with Sporadic FTD, a predominantly right cortical atrophy pattern was localized in the inferior frontal, medial orbitofrontal, precentral gyri, and the anterior insula. White matter atrophy was found in both medial and inferior frontal gyri, pallidum, and putamen. FTD/SQSTM1 carriers compared with HC/SQSTM1 noncarriers showed atrophy at frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of both hemispheres whereas the MRI pattern found in Sporadic FTD compared with controls was frontal and left temporal lobe atrophy, extending toward parietal and occipital lobes of both hemispheres. Conclusions: These results suggest that fronto-orbito-insular regions including corticospinal projections as described in ALS are probably more susceptible to the damaging effect of SQSTM1 mutations delineatinga specific gene-linked atrophy pattern.\", 'Convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage in lobar intracerebral hemorrhage: A prognostic marker. ObjectiveTo investigate whether acute convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) associated with acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) increases the risk of ICH recurrence in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).MethodsWe analyzed data from a prospective cohort of consecutive survivors of acute spontaneous lobar ICH fulfilling the Boston criteria for possible or probable CAA (CAA-ICH). We analyzed baseline clinical and MRI data, including cSAH (categorized as adjacent or remote from ICH on a standardized scale), cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and other CAA MRI markers. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the association between cSAH and recurrent symptomatic ICH during follow-up.ResultsWe included 261 CAA-ICH survivors (mean age 76.2 ± 8.7 years). Of them, 166 (63.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 57.7%-69.5%) had cSAH on baseline MRI. During a median follow-up of 28.3 (interquartile range 7.2-57.0) months, 54 (20.7%) patients experienced a recurrent lobar ICH. In Cox regression, any cSAH, adjacent cSAH, and remote cSAH were independent predictors of recurrent ICH after adjustment for other confounders, including cSS. Incidence rate of recurrent ICH in patients with cSAH was 9.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI 7.3-13.0) compared with 1.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.3-3.2) in those without cSAH (adjusted hazard ratio 7.5, 95% CI 2.6-21.1).ConclusionIn patients with CAA-related acute ICH, cSAH (adjacent or remote from lobar ICH) is commonly observed and heralds an increased risk of recurrent ICH. cSAH may help stratify bleeding risk and should be assessed along with cSS for prognosis and clinical management.', 'Free-flying honeybees extrapolate relational size rules to sort successively visited artificial flowers in a realistic foraging situation. Learning and applying relational concepts to solve novel tasks is considered an indicator of cognitive-like ability. It requires the abstraction of relational concepts to different objects independent to the physical nature of the individual objects. Recent research has revealed the honeybee’s ability to rapidly learn and manipulate relations between visual stimuli such as ‘same/different’, ‘above/below’, or ‘larger/smaller’ despite having a miniature-sized brain. While honeybees can solve problems using rule-based relative size comparison, it remains unresolved as to whether bees can apply size rules when stimuli are encountered successively, which requires reliance on working memory for stimuli comparison. Additionally, the potential ability of bees to extrapolate acquired information to novel sizes beyond training sets remains to be investigated. We tested whether individual free-flying honeybees could learn ‘larger/smaller’ size rules when visual stimuli were presented successively, and whether such rules could then be extrapolated to novel stimulus sizes. Honeybees were individually trained to a set of four sizes such that individual elements might be correct, or incorrect, depending upon the alternative stimulus. In a learning test, bees preferred the correct size relation for their respective learning group. Bees were also able to successfully extrapolate the learnt relation during transfer tests by maintaining the correct size relationships when considering either two smaller, or two larger, novel stimulus sizes. This performance demonstrates that an insect operating in a complex environment has sufficient cognitive capacity to learn rules that can be abstracted to novel problems. We discuss the possible learning mechanisms which allow their success.', \"Slowness in movement initiation is associated with proactive inhibitory network dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Background: Impairment in initiating movements in PD might be related to executive dysfunction associated with abnormal proactive inhibitory control, a pivotal mechanism consisting in gating movement initiation in uncertain contexts. Objective: Testing this hypothesis on the basis of direct neural-based evidence. Methods: Twelve PD patients on antiparkinsonian medication and fifteen matched healthy controls performed a simple reaction time task during event-related functional MRI scanning. Results: For all subjects, the level of activation of SMA was found to predict RT on a trial-by-trial basis. The increase in movement initiation latency observed in PD patients with regard to controlswas associated with pre-stimulus BOLD increases within several nodes of the proactive inhibitory network (caudate nucleus, precuneus, thalamus). Conclusions: These results provide physiological data consistent with impaired control of proactive inhibition over motor initiation in PD. Patients would be locked into a mode of control maintaining anticipated inhibition over willed movements even when the situation does not require action restraint. The functional and neurochemical bases of brain activity associated with executive settings need to be addressed thoroughly in future studies to better understand disabling symptoms that have few therapeutic options like akinesia.\", 'Consensus paper of the WFSBP Task Force on Biological Markers: Criteria for biomarkers and endophenotypes of schizophrenia part II: Cognition, neuroimaging and genetics. Objectives: Schizophrenia is a group of severe psychiatric disorders with high heritability but only low odds ratios of risk genes. Despite progress in the identification of pathophysiological processes, valid biomarkers of the disease are still lacking. Methods: This comprehensive review summarises recent efforts to identify genetic underpinnings, clinical and cognitive endophenotypes and symptom dimensions of schizophrenia and presents findings from neuroimaging studies with structural, functional and spectroscopy magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. The potential of findings to be biomarkers of schizophrenia is discussed. Results: Recent findings have not resulted in clear biomarkers for schizophrenia. However, we identified several biomarkers that are potential candidates for future research. Among them, copy number variations and links between genetic polymorphisms derived from genome-wide analysis studies, clinical or cognitive phenotypes, multimodal neuroimaging findings including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the application of multivariate pattern analyses are promising. Conclusions: Future studies should address the effects of treatment and stage of the disease more precisely and apply combinations of biomarker candidates. Although biomarkers for schizophrenia await validation, knowledge on candidate genomic and neuroimaging biomarkers is growing rapidly and research on this topic has the potential to identify psychiatric endophenotypes and in the future increase insight on individual treatment response in schizophrenia.', 'Communication between brain areas based on nested oscillations. Unraveling how brain regions communicate is crucial for understanding how the brain processes external and internal information. Neuronal oscillations within and across brain regions have been proposed to play a crucial role in this process. Two main hypotheses have been suggested for routing of information based on oscillations, namely communication through coherence and gating by inhibition. Here, we propose a framework unifying these two hypotheses that is based on recent empirical findings. We discuss a theory in which communication between two regions is established by phase synchronization of oscillations at lower frequencies (<25 Hz), which serve as temporal reference frame for information carried by high-frequency activity (<40 Hz). Our framework, consistent with numerous recent empirical findings, posits that cross-frequency interactions are essential for understanding how large-scale cognitive and perceptual networks operate.', 'Behavioral and Brain Functions at 15. ', \"Imaging evolution of the primate brain: the next frontier?. Evolution, as we currently understand it, strikes a delicate balance between animals' ancestral history and adaptations to their current niche. Similarities between species are generally considered inherited from a common ancestor whereas observed differences are considered as more recent evolution. Hence comparing species can provide insights into the evolutionary history. Comparative neuroimaging has recently emerged as a novel subdiscipline, which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify similarities and differences in brain structure and function across species. Whereas invasive histological and molecular techniques are superior in spatial resolution, they are laborious, post-mortem, and oftentimes limited to specific species. Neuroimaging, by comparison, has the advantages of being applicable across species and allows for fast, whole-brain, repeatable, and multi-modal measurements of the structure and function in living brains and post-mortem tissue. In this review, we summarise the current state of the art in comparative anatomy and function of the brain and gather together the main scientific questions to be explored in the future of the fascinating new field of brain evolution derived from comparative neuroimaging.\", 'LC-MS/MS-based quantification of kynurenine metabolites, tryptophan, monoamines and neopterin in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and brain. Aim: The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is implicated in diseases such as cancer, psychiatric, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Measurement of KYN metabolite levels will help elucidating the involvement of the KYN pathway in the disease pathology and inform drug development. Methodology: Samples of plasma, cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue were spiked with deuterated internal standards, processed and analyzed by LC-MS/MS; analytes were chromatographically separated by gradient elution on a C18 reversed phase analytical column without derivatization. Conclusion: We established an LC-MS/MS method to measure 11 molecules, namely tryptophan, KYN, 3-OH-KYN, 3-OH-anthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, picolinic acid, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, serotonin, dopamine and neopterin within 5.5 min, with sufficient sensitivity to quantify these molecules in small sample volumes of plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.', 'Awake craniotomy and memory induction through electrical stimulation: Why are Penfield’s findings not replicated in the modern era?. From the 1930s through the early 1960s, Wilder Penfield12 collected a large number of memories induced by electrical brain stimulation (EBS) during awake craniotomy. As a result, he was a major contributor to several neuroscientific and neuropsychological concepts of long-term memory. His 1963 paper, which recorded all the cases of memories he induced in his operating room, remains a substantial point of reference in neuroscience in 2019, although some of his interpretations are now debatable. However, it is highly surprising that, since Penfield’s12 reports, there has been no other surgical publication on memories induced during awake surgery. In this review, we explore this phenomenon and analyze some of the reasons that might explain it. We hypothesize that the main reasons for lack of subsequent reports are related to changes in operative procedures (ie, use of anesthetics, time constraints, and insufficient debriefings) and changes in EBS parameters, rather than to the sites that are stimulated, the pathology treated, or the tasks used. If reminiscences are still induced, they should be reported in detail to add valuable contributions to the understanding of long-term memory networks, especially memories that are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, such as autobiographical memories.', 'Thrombocytosis and central nervous system involvement in a case of canine acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. This case report presents a 14-month-old female Poodle mix with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia based on a marked thrombocytosis, abnormal platelet morphology, circulating dwarf megakaryocytes, and blast cells in the blood. Bone marrow abnormalities included dysmegakaryopoiesis dygranulopoiesis, and an increased number of blast cells was observed in the blood. Extensive leukemic involvement was also found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, kidneys, and brain. The cytopathologic features of the abnormal circulating cells were highly suggestive of being megakaryocytic in origin, which was supported by negative myeloperoxidase staining and positive von Willebrand factor staining on immunocytochemistry (ICC). The neoplastic cells were also CD61 positive and had variable von Willebrand factor expression on ICC. Although there were only 25% blast cells in the bone marrow, which theoretically supported myelodysplastic syndrome, the hypothesis that this case represented acute myeloid leukemia of megakaryoblastic origin was confirmed by the continuous increase in circulating blast cell numbers during follow-up visits and the extensive leukemic involvement of parenchymal organs.', 'Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of interneuronopathy in humans. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, notably the GABAergic system and has been recognised for a long time as particularly damaging during critical stages of brain development. Nevertheless, data from the literature are most often derived from animal or in vitro models. In order to study the production, migration and cortical density disturbances of GABAergic interneurons upon prenatal alcohol exposure, we performed immunohistochemical studies by means of the proliferation marker Ki67, GABA and calretinin antibodies in the frontal cortical plate of 17 foetal and infant brains antenatally exposed to alcohol, aged 15\\xa0weeks’ gestation to 22 postnatal months and in the ganglionic eminences and the subventricular zone of the dorsal telencephalon until their regression, i.e., 34\\xa0weeks’ gestation. Results were compared with those obtained in 17 control brains aged 14\\xa0weeks of gestation to 35 postnatal months. We also focused on interneuron vascular migration along the cortical microvessels by confocal microscopy with double immunolabellings using Glut1, GABA and calretinin. Semi-quantitative and quantitative analyses of GABAergic and calretininergic interneuron density allowed us to identify an insufficient and delayed production of GABAergic interneurons in the ganglionic eminences during the two first trimesters of the pregnancy and a delayed incorporation into the laminar structures of the frontal cortex. Moreover, a mispositioning of GABAergic and calretininergic interneurons persisted throughout the foetal life, these cells being located in the deep layers instead of the superficial layers II and III. Moreover, vascular migration of calretininergic interneurons within the cortical plate was impaired, as reflected by low numbers of interneurons observed close to the cortical perforating vessel walls that may in part explain their abnormal intracortical distribution. Our results are globally concordant with those previously obtained in mouse models, in which alcohol has been shown to induce an interneuronopathy by affecting interneuron density and positioning within the cortical plate, and which could account for the neurological disabilities observed in children with foetal alcohol disorder spectrum.', 'Essential omega-3 fatty acids tune microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements in the mouse developing brain. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are essential for the functional maturation of the brain. Westernization of dietary habits in both developed and developing countries is accompanied by a progressive reduction in dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs. Low maternal intake of n-3 PUFAs has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases in Humans. However, the n-3 PUFAs deficiency-mediated mechanisms affecting the development of the central nervous system are poorly understood. Active microglial engulfment of synapses regulates brain development. Impaired synaptic pruning is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism for detrimental effects of low maternal n-3 PUFA intake on hippocampal development in mice. Our results show that maternal dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency increases microglia-mediated phagocytosis of synaptic elements in the rodent developing hippocampus, partly through the activation of 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX)/12-HETE signaling, altering neuronal morphology and affecting cognitive performance of the offspring. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into neurodevelopmental defects caused by maternal n-3 PUFAs dietary deficiency.', 'Spatio-spectral regularization to improve magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging quantification. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a non-invasive technique able to provide the spatial distribution of relevant biochemical compounds commonly used as biomarkers of disease. Information provided by MRSI can be used as a valuable insight for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of several diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders. Obtaining accurate metabolite concentrations from in vivo MRSI signals is a crucial requirement for the clinical utility of this technique. Despite the numerous publications on the topic, accurate quantification is still a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data, overlap of spectral lines and the presence of nuisance components. We propose a novel quantification method, which alleviates these limitations by exploiting a spatio-spectral regularization scheme. In contrast to previous methods, the regularization terms are not expressed directly on the parameters being sought, but on appropriate transformed domains. In order to quantify all signals simultaneously in the MRSI grid, while introducing prior information, a fast proximal optimization algorithm is proposed. Experiments on synthetic MRSI data demonstrate that the error in the estimated metabolite concentrations is reduced by a mean of 41% with the proposed scheme. Results on in vivo brain MRSI data show the benefit of the proposed approach, which is able to fit overlapping peaks correctly and to capture metabolites that are missed by single-voxel methods due to their lower concentrations.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease, implying that multi-target treatments may be necessary to effectively cure AD. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an enzymatic cofactor required for the synthesis of monoamines and nitric oxide that also exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite its crucial role in the CNS, the potential of BH4 as a treatment in AD has never been scrutinized. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated whether BH4 peripheral administration improves cognitive symptoms and AD neuropathology in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), a model of age-related tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) neuropathologies associated with behavior impairment. METHODS: Non-transgenic (NonTg) and 3xTg-AD mice were subjected to a control diet (5% fat - CD) or to a high-fat diet (35% fat - HFD) from 6 to 13 months to exacerbate metabolic disorders. Then, mice received either BH4 (15\\u200amg/kg/day, i.p.) or vehicle for ten consecutive days. RESULTS: This sub-chronic administration of BH4 rescued memory impairment in 13-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, as determined using the novel object recognition test. Moreover, the HFD-induced glucose intolerance was completely reversed by the BH4 treatment in 3xTg-AD mice. However, the HFD or BH4 treatment had no significant impact on Aβ and tau neuropathologies. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest a potential benefit from BH4 administration against AD cognitive and metabolic deficits accentuated by HFD consumption in 3xTg-AD mice, without altering classical neuropathology. Therefore, BH4 should be considered as a candidate for drug repurposing, at least in subtypes of cognitively impaired patients experiencing metabolic disorders.\", 'Thinking outside the cell: Super-resolution shadow imaging (SUSHI) of the extracellular space of the brain. ', 'Exome chip analysis identifies low-frequency and rare variants in MRPL38 for white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Background and Purpose-White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain magnetic resonance imaging are typical signs of cerebral small vessel disease and may indicate various preclinical, age-related neurological disorders, such as stroke. Though WMH are highly heritable, known common variants explain a small proportion of the WMH variance. The contribution of low-frequency/rare coding variants to WMH burden has not been explored. Methods-In the discovery sample we recruited 20 719 stroke/dementia-free adults from 13 population-based cohort studies within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, among which 17 790 were of European ancestry and 2929 of African ancestry. We genotyped these participants at ≈250 000 mostly exonic variants with Illumina HumanExome BeadChip arrays. We performed ethnicity-specific linear regression on rank-normalized WMH in each study separately, which were then combined in meta-analyses to test for association with single variants and genes aggregating the effects of putatively functional low-frequency/rare variants. We then sought replication of the top findings in 1192 adults (European ancestry) with whole exome/genome sequencing data from 2 independent studies. Results-At 17q25, we confirmed the association of multiple common variants in TRIM65, FBF1, and ACOX1 (P<6×10−7). We also identified a novel association with 2 low-frequency nonsynonymous variants in MRPL38 (lead, rs34136221; PEA=4.5×10−8) partially independent of known common signal (PEA(conditional)=1.4×10−3). We further identified a locus at 2q33 containing common variants in NBEAL1, CARF, and WDR12 (lead, rs2351524; Pall=1.9×10−10). Although our novel findings were not replicated because of limited power and possible differences in study design, meta-analysis of the discovery and replication samples yielded stronger association for the 2 low-frequency MRPL38 variants (Prs34136221=2.8×10−8). Conclusions-Both common and low-frequency/rare functional variants influence WMH. Larger replication and experimental follow-up are essential to confirm our findings and uncover the biological causal mechanisms of age-related WMH.', 'Spines slow down dendritic chloride diffusion and affect short-term ionic plasticity of GABAergic inhibition. Cl- plays a crucial role in neuronal function and synaptic inhibition. However, the impact of neuronal morphology on the diffusion and redistribution of intracellular Cl- is not well understood. The role of spines in Cl- diffusion along dendritic trees has not been addressed so far. Because measuring fast and spatially restricted Cl- changes within dendrites is not yet technically possible, we used computational approaches to predict the effects of spines on Cl- dynamics in morphologically complex dendrites. In all morphologies tested, including dendrites imaged by super-resolution STED microscopy in live brain tissue, spines slowed down longitudinal Cl- diffusion along dendrites. This effect was robust and could be observed in both deterministic as well as stochastic simulations. Cl- extrusion altered Cl- diffusion to a much lesser extent than the presence of spines. The spine-dependent slowing of Cl- diffusion affected the amount and spatial spread of changes in the GABA reversal potential thereby altering homosynaptic as well as heterosynaptic short-term ionic plasticity at GABAergic synapses in dendrites. Altogether, our results suggest a fundamental role of dendritic spines in shaping Cl- diffusion, which could be of relevance in the context of pathological conditions where spine densities and neural excitability are perturbed.', 'Measuring alterations in oscillatory brain networks in schizophrenia with resting-state MEG: State-of-the-art and methodological challenges. Objective Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of disturbed resting-state brain networks in Schizophrenia (SZ). However, untangling the neuronal mechanisms that subserve these baseline alterations requires measurement of their electrophysiological underpinnings. This systematic review specifically investigates the contributions of resting-state Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in elucidating abnormal neural organization in SZ patients. Method A systematic literature review of resting-state MEG studies in SZ was conducted. This literature is discussed in relation to findings from resting-state fMRI and EEG, as well as to task-based MEG research in SZ population. Importantly, methodological limitations are considered and recommendations to overcome current limitations are proposed. Results Resting-state MEG literature in SZ points towards altered local and long-range oscillatory network dynamics in various frequency bands. Critical methodological challenges with respect to experiment design, and data collection and analysis need to be taken into consideration. Conclusion Spontaneous MEG data show that local and global neural organization is altered in SZ patients. MEG is a highly promising tool to fill in knowledge gaps about the neurophysiology of SZ. However, to reach its fullest potential, basic methodological challenges need to be overcome. Significance MEG-based resting-state power and connectivity findings could be great assets to clinical and translational research in psychiatry, and SZ in particular.', \"Intensity patterns at the peaks of brain activity in fMRI and PET are highly correlated with neural models of spatial integration. Spatial integration during the brain's cognitive activity prompts changes in energy used by different neuroglial populations. Nevertheless, the organisation of such integration in 3D -brain activity remains undescribed from a quantitative standpoint. In response, we applied a cross-correlation between brain activity and integrative models, which yielded a deeper understanding of information integration in functional brain mapping. We analysed four datasets obtained via fundamentally different neuroimaging techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] and positron emission tomography [PET]) and found that models of spatial integration with an increasing input to each step of integration were significantly more correlated with brain activity than models with a constant input to each step of integration. In addition, marking the voxels with the maximal correlation, we found exceptionally high intersubject consistency with the initial brain activity at the peaks. Our method demonstrated for the first time that the network of peaks of brain activity is organised strictly according to the models of spatial integration independent of neuroimaging techniques. The highest correlation with models integrating an increasing at each step input suggests that brain activity reflects a network of integrative processes where the results of integration in some neuroglial populations serve as an input to other neuroglial populations.\", 'Decreased frontal white-matter diffusion and improved cognitive flexibility after burr-hole surgery in moyamoya angiopathy. Background: In Moyamoya Angioplasty (MMA), increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in frontal white matter (WM) with a normal appearance has been associated with frontal hypoperfusion and executive dysfunction. Multiple burr-hole surgery enables the revascularization of large frontal areas. Goal: To assess the effect of multiple burr-hole surgery on the ADC and cognitive functions in adults with MMA. Methods: ADC was measured in 26 brain hemispheres of 14 consecutive adults with MMA (9 women, mean age ± SD: 38.1 ± 10.7 years) prior to and 6 months after burr-hole surgery. ADC was obtained from regions of interest located in frontal and posterior (temporo-occipital) normal-appearing WM. Ten patients had neuropsychological assessment that focused on executive and attentional functions before and after surgery. Results: Anterior and posterior ADC values did not differ before surgery (815.8 ± 60.1 vs. 812.1 ± 35.3 mm2/s, p = 0.88). After surgery, frontal ADC was lower than prior to surgery (789.9 ± 64.5 vs. 815.8 ± 60.1 mm2/s; p <0.001) whereas no change occurred in posterior ADC (p = 0.31). Trail-making test part B median z-score increased from - 1.47 to - 0.21 (p = 0.018), suggesting improved cognitive flexibility. Conclusion: In adults with MMA, indirect revascularization with burr-hole is followed by a decrease of ADC in normal-appearing frontal WM and may have improved some executive functions in the flexibility process. Change in ADC may reflect the improvement in cerebral perfusion after surgery. The measuring of ADC may be a promising tool in exploring potentially reversible microstructural WM damage related to hypoperfusion and cognitive change in MMA.', 'A review of user training methods in brain computer interfaces based on mental tasks. Mental-tasks based brain-computer interfaces (MT-BCIs) allow their users to interact with an external device solely by using brain signals produced through mental tasks. While MT-BCIs are promising for many applications, they are still barely used outside laboratories due to their lack of reliability. MT-BCIs require their users to develop the ability to self-regulate specific brain signals. However, the human learning process to control a BCI is still relatively poorly understood and how to optimally train this ability is currently under investigation. Despite their promises and achievements, traditional training programs have been shown to be sub-optimal and could be further improved. In order to optimize user training and improve BCI performance, human factors should be taken into account. An interdisciplinary approach should be adopted to provide learners with appropriate and/or adaptive training. In this article, we provide an overview of existing methods for MT-BCI user training - notably in terms of environment, instructions, feedback and exercises. We present a categorization and taxonomy of these training approaches, provide guidelines on how to choose the best methods and identify open challenges and perspectives to further improve MT-BCI user training.', 'Defining clinical subgroups and genotype–phenotype correlations in NBAS-associated disease across 110 patients. Purpose: Pathogenic variants in neuroblastoma-amplified sequence (NBAS) cause an autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of symptoms affecting liver, skeletal system, and brain, among others. There is a continuously growing number of patients but a lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. Methods: Individuals with biallelic variants in NBAS were recruited within an international, multicenter study, including novel and previously published patients. Clinical variables were analyzed with log-linear models and visualized by mosaic plots; facial profiles were investigated via DeepGestalt. The structure of the NBAS protein was predicted using computational methods. Results: One hundred ten individuals from 97 families with biallelic pathogenic NBAS variants were identified, including 26 novel patients with 19 previously unreported variants, giving a total number of 86 variants. Protein modeling redefined the β-propeller domain of NBAS. Based on the localization of missense variants and in-frame deletions, three clinical subgroups arise that differ significantly regarding main clinical features and are directly related to the affected region of the NBAS protein: β-propeller (combined phenotype), Sec39 (infantile liver failure syndrome type 2/ILFS2), and C-terminal (short stature, optic atrophy, and Pelger–Huët anomaly/SOPH). Conclusion: We define clinical subgroups of NBAS-associated disease that can guide patient management and point to domain-specific functions of NBAS.', 'TractLearn: A geodesic learning framework for quantitative analysis of brain bundles. Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks have recently proved their efficiency in providing fast segmentation of major brain fascicles structures, based on diffusion-weighted imaging. The quantitative analysis of brain fascicles then relies on metrics either coming from the tractography process itself or from each voxel along the bundle. Statistical detection of abnormal voxels in the context of disease usually relies on univariate and multivariate statistics models, such as the General Linear Model (GLM). Yet in the case of high-dimensional low sample size data, the GLM often implies high standard deviation range in controls due to anatomical variability, despite the commonly used smoothing process. This can lead to difficulties to detect subtle quantitative alterations from a brain bundle at the voxel scale. Here we introduce TractLearn, a unified framework for brain fascicles quantitative analyses by using geodesic learning as a data-driven learning task. TractLearn allows a mapping between the image high-dimensional domain and the reduced latent space of brain fascicles using a Riemannian approach. We illustrate the robustness of this method on a healthy population with test-retest acquisition of multi-shell diffusion MRI data, demonstrating that it is possible to separately study the global effect due to different MRI sessions from the effect of local bundle alterations. We have then tested the efficiency of our algorithm on a sample of 5 age-matched subjects referred with mild traumatic brain injury. Our contributions are to propose: 1/ A manifold approach to capture controls variability as standard reference instead of an atlas approach based on a Euclidean mean. 2/ A tool to detect global variation of voxels’ quantitative values, which accounts for voxels’ interactions in a structure rather than analyzing voxels independently. 3/ A ready-to-plug algorithm to highlight nonlinear variation of diffusion MRI metrics. With this regard, TractLearn is a ready-to-use algorithm for precision medicine.', 'A new glioblastoma cell trap for implantation after surgical resection. Glioblastoma (GB) is a highly infiltrative tumor, recurring, in 90% of cases, within a few centimeters of the surgical resection cavity, even with adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Residual GB cells left in the margins or infiltrating the brain parenchyma shelter behind the extremely fragile and sensitive brain tissue and may favor recurrence. Tools for eliminating these cells without damaging the brain microenvironment are urgently required. We propose a strategy involving the implantation, into the tumor bed after resection, of a scaffold to concentrate and trap these cells, to facilitate their destruction by targeted therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery. We used bacterial cellulose (BC), an easily synthesized and modifiable random nanofibrous biomaterial, to make the trap. We showed that the structure of BC membranes was ideal for trapping tumor cells and that BC implants were biocompatible with brain parenchyma. We also demonstrated the visibility of BC on magnetic resonance imaging, making it possible to follow its fate in clinical situations and to define the target volume for stereotactic radiosurgery more precisely. Furthermore, BC membranes can be loaded with chemoattractants, which were released and attracted tumor cells in vitro. This is of particular interest for trapping GB cells infiltrating tissues within a few centimeters of the resection cavity. Our data suggest that BC membranes could be a scaffold of choice for implantation after surgical resection to trap residual GB cells. Statement of Significance: Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative tumor, recurring, in 90% of cases, within a few centimeters of the surgical resection cavity, even with adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Residual tumor cells left in the margins or infiltrating the brain parenchyma shelter behind the extremely fragile and sensitive brain tissue and contribute to the risk of recurrence. Finding tools to eliminate these cells without damaging the brain microenvironment is a real challenge. We propose a strategy involving the implantation, into the walls of the surgical resection cavity, of a scaffold to concentrate and trap the residual tumor cells, to facilitate their destruction by targeted therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery.', 'The potential neuroprotective role of free and encapsulated quercetin mediated by mirna against neurological diseases. Chronic neuroinflammation is a pathological condition of numerous central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the microglia activation and concomitant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to an increasing neuronal cell death. The decreased neuroinflammation could be obtained by using natural compounds, including flavonoids known to modulate the inflammatory responses. Among flavonoids, quercetin possess multiple pharmacological applications including anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, antiapoptotic and anti-thrombotic activities, widely demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In this review, we describe the recent findings about the neuroprotective action of quercetin by acting with different mechanisms on the microglial cells of CNS. The ability of quercetin to influence microRNA expression represents an interesting skill in the regulation of inflammation, differentiation, proliferation, apopto-sis and immune responses. Moreover, in order to enhance quercetin bioavailability and capacity to target the brain, we discuss an innovative drug delivery system. In summary, this review highlighted an important application of quercetin in the modulation of neuroinflammation and prevention of neurological disorders.', 'Extrinsic and default mode networks in psychiatric conditions: Relationship to excitatory-inhibitory transmitter balance and early trauma. Over the last three decades there has been an accumulation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies reporting that aberrant functional networks may underlie cognitive deficits and other symptoms across a range of psychiatric diagnoses. The use of pharmacological MRI and 1 H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) has allowed researchers to investigate how changes in network dynamics are related to perturbed excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in individuals with psychiatric conditions. More recently, changes in functional network dynamics and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission have been linked to early childhood trauma, a major antecedents for psychiatric illness in adulthood. Here we review studies investigating whether perturbed network dynamics seen across psychiatric conditions are related to changes in E/I neurotransmission, and whether such changes could be linked to childhood trauma. Whilst there is currently a paucity of studies relating early traumatic experiences to altered E/I balance and network function, the research discussed here lead towards a plausible mechanistic hypothesis, linking early traumatic experiences to cognitive dysfunction and symptoms mediated by E/I neurotransmitter imbalances.', 'Boosting brain motor plasticity with physical exercise. ', 'Topographic patterns of white matter hyperintensities are associated with multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequently found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Commonly considered as a marker of cerebrovascular disease, regional WMH may be related to pathological hallmarks of AD, including beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to examine the regional distribution of WMH associated with Aβ burden, glucose hypometabolism, and gray matter volume reduction. Methods: In a total of 155 participants (IMAP+ cohort) across the cognitive continuum from normal cognition\\xa0to AD dementia, FLAIR MRI, AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and T1 MRI were acquired. WMH were automatically segmented from FLAIR images. Mean levels of neocortical Aβ deposition (AV45-PET), temporo-parietal glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and medial-temporal gray matter volume (GMV) were extracted from processed images using established AD meta-signature templates. Associations between AD\\xa0brain biomarkers and WMH, as assessed in region-of-interest and voxel-wise, were examined, adjusting for age, sex, education, and systolic blood pressure. Results: There were no significant associations between global Aβ burden and region-specific WMH. Voxel-wise WMH in the splenium of the corpus callosum correlated with greater Aβ deposition at a more liberal threshold. Region- and voxel-based WMH in the posterior corpus callosum, along with parietal, occipital, and frontal areas, were associated with lower temporo-parietal glucose metabolism. Similarly, lower medial-temporal GMV correlated with WMH in the posterior corpus callosum in addition to parietal, occipital, and fontal areas. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that local white matter damage is correlated with multimodal brain biomarkers of AD. Our results highlight modality-specific topographic patterns of WMH, which converged in the posterior white matter. Overall, these cross-sectional findings corroborate associations of regional WMH with AD-typical Aß deposition and neurodegeneration.', \"Prenatal infection leads to ASD-like behavior and altered synaptic pruning in the mouse offspring. Environmental challenges to the maternal immune system during pregnancy have been associated with an increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) appearing in the offspring. Microglia, the brain's resident immune-cells, are now known to be critically involved in normal brain development, shaping connections between neurons by pruning superfluous synaptic spines. Our aim was to investigate whether maternal infection during critical stages of gestation compromises the role of microglia in sculpting neuronal circuits. Using a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we assayed the offspring's behavior during postnatal development. Additionally, we quantified spines within the offspring's brain and assessed alterations in some molecular signals involved in pruning. LPS-induced MIA led to behavioral changes relevant to ASD in the offspring in the absence of gross neurological problems. Prenatal LPS resulted in a significant increase in the number of spines in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, as well as a reduction in hippocampal expression of the fractalkine microglial receptor (CX3CR1), involved in mediating the pruning process in the offspring. Interestingly, these changes were only noted in the male progeny of the LPS challenged dams. These results provide an early indicator that microglial function is altered in the brain of offspring from immune challenged mothers and that the effects in the brain appear to be specific along sex lines.\", 'Could LC-NE-Dependent adjustment of neural gain drive functional brain network reorganization?. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system is thought to act at synaptic, cellular, microcircuit, and network levels to facilitate cognitive functions through at least two different processes, not mutually exclusive. Accordingly, as a reset signal, the LC-NE system could trigger brain network reorganizations in response to salient information in the environment and/or adjust the neural gain within its target regions to optimize behavioral responses. Here, we provide evidence of the co-occurrence of these two mechanisms at the whole-brain level, in resting-state conditions following a pharmacological stimulation of the LC-NE system. We propose that these two mechanisms are interdependent such that the LC-NE-dependent adjustment of the neural gain inferred from the clustering coefficient could drive functional brain network reorganizations through coherence in the gamma rhythm. Via the temporal dynamic of gamma-range band-limited power, the release of NE could adjust the neural gain, promoting interactions only within the neuronal populations whose amplitude envelopes are correlated, thus making it possible to reorganize neuronal ensembles, functional networks, and ultimately, behavioral responses. Thus, our proposal offers a unified framework integrating the putative influence of the LC-NE system on both local- and long-range adjustments of brain dynamics underlying behavioral flexibility.', 'Autism-Like Behaviours and Memory Deficits Result from a Western Diet in Mice. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, induced by a Western diet (WD), evokes central and peripheral inflammation that is accompanied by altered emotionality. These changes can be associated with abnormalities in social behaviour, hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions, and metabolism. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed with a regular chow or with a WD containing 0.2% of cholesterol and 21% of saturated fat for three weeks. WD-treated mice exhibited increased social avoidance, crawl-over and digging behaviours, decreased body-body contacts, and hyperlocomotion. The WD-fed group also displayed deficits in hippocampal-dependent performance such as contextual memory in a fear conditioning and pellet displacement paradigms. A reduction in glucose tolerance and elevated levels of serum cholesterol and leptin were also associated with the WD. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1a) mRNA, a marker of mitochondrial activity, was decreased in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and dorsal raphe, suggesting suppressed brain mitochondrial functions, but not in the liver. This is the first report to show that a WD can profoundly suppress social interactions and induce dominant-like behaviours in naïve adult mice. The spectrum of behaviours that were found to be induced are reminiscent of symptoms associated with autism, and, if paralleled in humans, suggest that a WD might exacerbate autism spectrum disorder.', 'Deciphering the causes of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias: a prospective study with implications for diagnostic work. The management of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias represents a very heterogeneous group of patients and remains a challenge for neurologist in clinical practice. We aimed at describing the different causes of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias that were diagnosed following standardized, exhaustive investigations and the population characteristics according to the aetiologies as well as at evaluating the relevance of these investigations. All patients consecutively referred to our centre due to sporadic, progressive cerebellar ataxia occurring after 40\\xa0years of age were included in the prospective, observational study. 80 patients were included over a 2\\xa0year period. A diagnosis was established for 52 patients (65%) corresponding to 18 distinct causes, the most frequent being cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy (n\\xa0=\\xa029). The second most frequent cause was inherited diseases (including spinocerebellar ataxias, late-onset Friedreich’s disease, SLC20A2 mutations, FXTAS, MELAS, and other mitochondrial diseases) (n\\xa0=\\xa09), followed by immune-mediated or other acquired causes. The group of patient without diagnosis showed a slower worsening of ataxia (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) than patients with multiple system atrophy. Patients with later age at onset experienced faster progression of ataxia (p\\xa0=\\xa00.001) and more frequently parkinsonism (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) than patients with earlier onset. Brain MRI, DaT scan, genetic analysis and to some extent muscle biopsy, thoracic-abdominal-pelvic tomodensitometry, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were the most relevant investigations to explore sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxia. Sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias should be exhaustively investigated to identify the underlying causes that are numerous, including inherited causes, but dominated by multiple system atrophy.', 'Brain mechanisms that underlie music interventions in the exercise domain. In this chapter we review recent work from the realms of neuroscience and neuropsychology to explore the brain mechanisms that underlie the effects of music on exercise. We begin with an examination of the technique of electroencephalography (EEG), which has proven popular with researchers in this domain. We go on to appraise work conducted with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and then, looking more toward the future, we consider the application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study brain hemodynamics. The experimental findings expounded herein indicate that music has the potential to guide attention toward environmental sensory cues and prevent internal, fatigue-related signals from entering focal awareness. The brain mechanisms underlying such effects are primarily associated with the downregulation of theta waves across the cortex surface, reduction of communication among somatosensory regions, and increased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Taken holistically, research in this subfield of exercise psychology demonstrates a vibrant and reflexive matrix of attentional, emotional, behavioral, physiological, and psychophysiological responses to music across a variety of exercise modalities and intensities. The emergent hypotheses that we propose can be used to frame future research efforts.', 'Guidance of spatial attention during associative learning: Contributions of predictability and intention to learn. Expectations of an event can facilitate its neural processing. One of the ways we build expectations is through associative learning. Interestingly, the learning of contingencies between events can also occur without intention. Here, we study feature-based attention during associative learning, by asking how a learned association between a cue and a target outcome impacts the attention allocated to this outcome. Moreover, we investigate attention in learning depending on the intention to learn the association. We used an associative learning paradigm where we manipulated outcome predictability and intention to learn an association within streams of cue-target outcome visual stimuli, while stimulus characteristics and probability were held constant. In order to measure the event-related component N2pc, widely recognized to reflect allocation of spatial attention, every outcome was embedded among distractors. Importantly, the location of the target outcome could not be anticipated. We found that predictable target outcomes showed an increased spatial attention as indexed by a greater N2pc component. A later component, the P300, was sensitive to the intention to learn the association between the cue and the target outcome. The current study confirms the remarkable ability of the brain to extract and update predictive information, in accordance with a predictive-coding model of brain function. Associative learning can guide a visual search and shape covert attentional selection in our rich environments.', \"Imaging the Addicted Brain: Alcohol. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a major public health issue due to its prevalence and severe health consequences. It may affect several aspects of an individual's life including work and relationships, and it also increases risk for additional problems such as brain injury. The causes and outcomes of AUD are varied; thus, attempting to understand this complex phenomenon requires investigation from multiple perspectives. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful means to investigate brain anatomical and functional alterations related to AUD. Recent advances in MRI methods allow better investigation of the alterations to structural and functional brain networks in AUD. Here, we focus on findings from studies using multiple MRI techniques, which converge to support the considerable vulnerability of frontal systems. Indeed, MRI studies provide evidence for a “disconnection syndrome” which could be involved in the poor behavioral control observed in AUD.\", \"ADAM30 Downregulates APP-Linked Defects Through Cathepsin D Activation in Alzheimer's Disease. Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been shown to contribute to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down- or up-regulation of ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in Aβ peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30mut) did not affect Aβ secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered Aβ42 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble Aβ42 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations. Our data thus indicate that lowering ADAM30 expression may favor Aβ production, thereby contributing to Alzheimer's disease development.\", 'Weston-Hurst syndrome with acute hemorrhagic cerebellitis. Weston-Hurst syndrome is an exceptional variant of ADEM characterized by brain hemorrhages. Lesions are usually supratentorial and death is a usual outcome. We report a cerebellar Weston-Hurst syndrome early treated by craniectomy, steroids and plasma exchange. This is the first case of infratentorial Weston-Hurst syndrome associated with a favorable outcome.', 'Crosstalk between brain, lung and heart in critical care. Extracerebral complications, especially pulmonary and cardiovascular, are frequent in brain-injured patients and are major outcome determinants. Two major pathways have been described: brain-lung and brain-heart interactions. Lung injuries after acute brain damages include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and neurogenic pulmonary œdema (NPE), whereas heart injuries can range from cardiac enzymes release, ECG abnormalities to left ventricle dysfunction or cardiogenic shock. The pathophysiologies of these brain-lung and brain-heart crosstalk are complex and sometimes interconnected. This review aims to describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of lung and heart injuries in brain-injured patients with the different pathways implicated and the clinical implications for critical care physicians.', 'Anatomic correlation of the mini-mental state examination: A voxel-based morphometric study in older adults. The clinical utility of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and its shorter version (SMMSE) is still debated. There is a need to better understand the neuroanatomical correlates of these cognitive tests. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether lower MMSE and SMMSE scores correlated with focal brain volume reduction in older adults. Participants from the GAIT study (n = 207; mean, 70.9±5.9 years; 57% female; mean MMSE 26.2±3.9; mean SMMSE 5.1±1.1) were evaluated using the MMSE and SMMSE and received a 1.5-Tesla MRI scan of the brain. Cortical gray and white matter subvolumes were automatically segmented using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Age, gender, education level, and total intracranial volume were included as potential confounders. We found correlations between the MMSE score and specific cortical regions of the limbic system including the hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, independently of the diagnostic category (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease or controls). Regarding correlations with the SMMSE score, only one cluster in the left hippocampus was identified, which overlapped with the cluster that was positively correlated with the MMSE score. There were no correlations with the volume of white matter. In conclusion, worse MMSE and SMMSE scores were associated with gray matter atrophy mainly in the limbic system. This finding highlights that atrophy of specific brain regions are related to performance on the MMSE and the SMMSE tests, and provides new insights into the cognitive function probed by these tests.', 'Ecologically relevant neurobehavioral assessment of the development of threat learning. As altricial infants gradually transition to adults, their proximate environment changes. In three short weeks, pups transition from a small world with the caregiver and siblings to a complex milieu rich in dangers as their environment expands. Such contrasting environments require different learning abilities and lead to distinct responses throughout development. Here, we will review some of the learned fear conditioned responses to threats in rats during their ontogeny, including behavioral and physiological measures that permit the assessment of learning and its supporting neurobiology from infancy through adulthood. In adulthood, odor-shock conditioning produces robust fear learning to the odor that depends upon the amygdala and related circuitry. Paradoxically, this conditioning in young pups fails to support fear learning and supports approach learning to the odor previously paired with shock. This approach learning is mediated by the infant attachment network that does not include the amygdala. During the age range when pups transition from the infant to the adult circuit (10-15 d old), pups have access to both networks: odor-shock conditioning in maternal presence uses the attachment circuit but the adult amygdala-dependent circuit when alone. However, throughout development (as young as 5 d old) the attachment associated learning can be overridden and amygdala-dependent fear learning supported, if the mother expresses fear in the presence of the pup. This social modulation of the fear permits the expression of defense reactions in life threatening situations informed by the caregiver but prevents the learning of the caregiver itself as a threat.', 'Central Nervous System Underpinnings of Sensory Hypersensitivity in Migraine: Insights from Neuroimaging and Electrophysiological Studies. Whereas considerable data have been generated about the pathophysiology of pain processing during migraine attacks, relatively little is known about the neural basis of sensory hypersensitivity. In migraine, the term “hypersensitivity” encompasses different and probably distinct pathophysiological aspects of sensory sensitivity. During attacks, many patients have enhanced sensitivity to visual, auditory and/or olfactory stimuli, which can enhance headache while interictally, migraineurs often report abnormal sensitivity to environmental stimuli that can cause nonpainful discomfort. In addition, sensorial stimuli can influence and trigger the onset of migraine attacks. The pathophysiological mechanisms and the origin of such sensitivity (individual predisposition to develop migraine disease or consequence of repeated migraine attacks) are ill understood. Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies allow for noninvasive measures of neuronal responses to external stimuli and have contributed to our understanding of mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity in migraine. The purpose of this review is to present pivotal neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies that explored the basal state of brain responsiveness to sensory stimuli in migraineurs, the alterations in habituation and attention to sensory inputs, the fluctuations of responsiveness to sensory stimuli before and during migraine attacks, and the relations between sensory hypersensitivity and clinical sensory complaints.', 'Recurrent DCC gene losses during bird evolution. During development, midline crossing by axons brings into play highly conserved families of receptors and ligands. The interaction between the secreted ligand Netrin-1 and its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC) is thought to control midline attraction of crossing axons. Here, we studied the evolution of this ligand/receptor couple in birds taking advantage of a wealth of newly sequenced genomes. From phylogeny and synteny analyses we can infer that the DCC gene has been conserved in most extant bird species, while two independent events have led to its loss in two avian groups, passeriformes and galliformes. These convergent accidental gene loss events are likely related to chromosome Z rearrangement. We show, using whole-mount immunostaining and 3Disco clearing, that in the nervous system of all birds that have a DCC gene, DCC protein expression pattern is similar to other vertebrates. Surprisingly, we show that the early developmental pattern of commissural tracts is comparable in all birds, whether or not they have a DCC receptor. Interestingly, only 4 of the 5 genes encoding secreted netrins, the DCC ligands in vertebrates, were found in birds, but Netrin-5 was absent. Together, these results support a remarkable plasticity of commissural axon guidance mechanisms in birds.', \"Herpes Simplex Virus-1 in the Brain: The Dark Side of a Sneaky Infection. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) establishes latency preferentially in sensory neurons of peripheral ganglia. A variety of stresses can induce recurrent reactivations of the virus, which spreads and then actively replicates to the site of primary infection (usually the lips or eyes). Viral particles produced following reactivation can also reach the brain, causing a rare but severe form of diffuse acute infection, namely herpes simplex encephalitis. Most of the time, this infection is clinically asymptomatic. However, it was recently correlated with the production and accumulation of neuropathological biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. In this review we discuss the different cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and long-term damage caused by HSV-1 infection in the brain.\", 'Mindfulness related changes in grey matter: a systematic review and meta‐analysis. Knowing target regions undergoing strfuncti changes caused by behavioural interventions is paramount in evaluating the effectiveness of such practices. Here, using a systematic review approach, we identified 25 peer-reviewed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating grey matter changes related to mindfulness meditation. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis (n = 16) revealed the right anterior ventral insula as the only significant region with consistent effect across studies, whilst an additional functional connectivity analysis indicates that both left and right insulae, and the anterior cingulate gyrus with adjacent paracingulate gyri should also be considered in future studies. Statistical meta-analyses suggest medium to strong effect sizes from Cohen’s d ~ 0.8 in the right insula to ~ 1 using maxima across the whole brain. The systematic review revealed design issues with selection, information, attrition and confirmation biases, in addition to weak statistical power. In conclusion, our analyses show that mindfulness meditation practice does induce grey matter changes but also that improvements in methodology are needed to establish mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention.', 'Giant axonal neuropathy: a multicenter retrospective study with genotypic spectrum expansion. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the GAN gene encoding gigaxonin. Patients develop a progressive sensorimotor neuropathy affecting peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). Methods: In this multicenter observational retrospective study, we recorded French patients with GAN mutations, and 10 patients were identified. Mean age of patients was 9.7 years (2–18), eight patients were female (80%), and all patients met infant developmental milestones and had a family history of consanguinity. Mean age at disease onset was 3.3 years (1–5), and progressive cerebellar ataxia and distal motor weakness were the initial symptoms in all cases. Proximal motor weakness and bulbar symptoms appeared at a mean age of 12 years (8–14), and patients used a wheelchair at a mean age of 16 years (14–18). One patient died at age 18 years from aspiration pneumonia. In all cases, nerve conduction studies showed a mixed demyelinating and axonal sensorimotor neuropathy and MRI showed brain and cerebellum white matter abnormalities. Polyneuropathy and encephalopathy both aggravated during the course of the disease. Patients also showed a variety of associated findings, including curly hair (100% of cases), pes cavus (80%), ophthalmic abnormalities (30%), and scoliosis (30%). Five new GAN mutations were found, including the first synonymous mutation and a large intragenic deletion. Our findings expand the genotypic spectrum of GAN mutations, with relevant implications for molecular analysis of this gene, and confirm that GAN is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease involving PNS and CNS.', 'fMRI capture of auditory hallucinations: Validation of the two-steps method. Our purpose was to validate a reliable method to capture brain activity concomitant with hallucinatory events, which constitute frequent and disabling experiences in schizophrenia. Capturing hallucinations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains very challenging. We previously developed a method based on a two-steps strategy including (1) multivariate data-driven analysis of per-hallucinatory fMRI recording and (2) selection of the components of interest based on a post-fMRI interview. However, two tests still need to be conducted to rule out critical pitfalls of conventional fMRI capture methods before this two-steps strategy can be adopted in hallucination research: replication of these findings on an independent sample and assessment of the reliability of the hallucination-related patterns at the subject level. To do so, we recruited a sample of 45 schizophrenia patients suffering from frequent hallucinations, 20 schizophrenia patients without hallucinations and 20 matched healthy volunteers; all participants underwent four different experiments. The main findings are (1) high accuracy in reporting unexpected sensory stimuli in an MRI setting; (2) good detection concordance between hypothesis-driven and data-driven analysis methods (as used in the two-steps strategy) when controlled unexpected sensory stimuli are presented; (3) good agreement of the two-steps method with the online button-press approach to capture hallucinatory events; (4) high spatial consistency of hallucinatory-related networks detected using the two-steps method on two independent samples. By validating the two-steps method, we advance toward the possible transfer of such technology to new image-based therapies for hallucinations.

Drug addiction is a complex behavioral and neurobiological disorder which, in an emergent brain-circuit view, reflects a loss of prefrontal top-down control over subcortical circuits governing drug-seeking and drug-taking. We first review previous computational accounts of addiction, focusing on cocaine addiction and on prevalent dopamine-based positive-reinforcement and negative-reinforcement computational models. Then, we discuss a recent computational proposal that the progression to addiction is unlikely to result from a complete withdrawal of the goal-oriented decision system in favor the habitual one. Rather, the transition to addiction would arise from a drug-induced alteration in the structure of organismal needs which reorganizes the goal structure, ultimately favoring predominance of drug-oriented goals. Finally, we outline unmet challenges for future computational research on addiction.', \"Routine assessment of cognitive function in older patients with hypertension seen by primary care physicians: Why and how-a decision-making support fromthe working group on'hypertension and the brain'of the European Society ofHypertension and fromthe European GeriatricMedicine Society. The guidelines on hypertension recently published by the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology, have acknowledged cognitive function (and its decline) as a hypertension-mediated organ damage. In fact, brain damage can be the only hypertension-mediated organ damage in more than 30% of hypertensive patients, evolving undetected for several years if not appropriately screened; as long as undetected it cannot provide either corrective measures, nor adequate risk stratification of the hypertensive patient. The medical community dealing with older hypertensive patients should have a simple and pragmatic approach to early identify and precisely treat these patients. Both hypertension and cognitive decline are undeniably growing pandemics in developed or epidemiologically transitioning societies. Furthermore, there is a clear-cut connection between exposure to the increased blood pressure and development of cognitive decline. Therefore, a group of experts in the field from the European Society of Hypertension and from the European Geriatric Medicine Society gathered together to answer practical clinical questions that often face the physician when dealing with their hypertensive patients in a routine clinical practice. They elaborated a decision-making approach to help standardize such clinical evaluation.\", 'Motor impairments correlate with social deficits and restricted neuronal loss in an environmental model of autism. Background: Motor impairments are amongst the earliest and most consistent signs of autism spectrum disorders but are not used as diagnostic criteria. In addition, the relationship between motor and cognitive impairments and their respective neural substrates remain unknown. Methods: Here, we aimed at determining whether a well-acknowledged animal model of autism spectrum disorders, the valproic acid model, displays motor impairments and whether they may correlate with social deficits and neuronal loss within motor brain areas. For this, pregnant female mice (C57BL/6J) received valproic acid (450 mg/kg) at embryonic day 12.5 and offspring underwent a battery of behavioral analyses before being killed for histological correlates in motor cortex, nigrostriatal pathway, and cerebellum. Results: We show that while valproic acid male mice show both social and motor impairments, female mice only show motor impairments. Prenatal valproic acid exposure induces specific cell loss within the motor cortex and cerebellum and that is of higher magnitude in males than in females. Finally, we demonstrate that motor dysfunction correlates with reduced social behavior and that motor and social deficits both correlate with a loss of Purkinje cells within the Crus I cerebellar area. Conclusions: Our results suggest that motor dysfunction could contribute to social and communication deficits in autism spectrum disorders and that motor and social deficits may share common neuronal substrates in the cerebellum. A systematic assessment of motor function in autism spectrum disorders may potentially help the quantitative diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and strategies aimed at improving motor behavior may provide a global therapeutic benefit.', 'The Edinburgh CT and genetic diagnostic criteria for lobar intracerebral haemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy: model development and diagnostic test accuracy study. Background: Identification of lobar spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is important because it is associated with a higher risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage than arteriolosclerosis-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. We aimed to develop a prediction model for the identification of CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage using CT features and genotype. Methods: We identified adults with first-ever intracerebral haemorrhage diagnosed by CT, who died and underwent research autopsy as part of the Lothian IntraCerebral Haemorrhage, Pathology, Imaging and Neurological Outcome (LINCHPIN) study, a prospective, population-based, inception cohort. We determined APOE genotype and radiologists rated CT imaging appearances. Radiologists were not aware of clinical, genetic, and histopathological features. A neuropathologist rated brain tissue for small vessel diseases, including CAA, and was masked to clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. We used CT and APOE genotype data in a logistic regression model, which we internally validated using bootstrapping, to predict the risk of CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, derive diagnostic criteria, and estimate diagnostic accuracy. Findings: Among 110 adults (median age 83 years [IQR 76–87], 49 [45%] men) included in the LINCHPIN study between June 1, 2010 and Feb 10, 2016, intracerebral haemorrhage was lobar in 62 (56%) participants, deep in 41 (37%), and infratentorial in seven (6%). Of the 62 participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, 36 (58%) were associated with moderate or severe CAA compared with 26 (42%) that were associated with absent or mild CAA, and were independently associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage (32 [89%] of 36 vs 11 [42%] of 26; p=0·014), intracerebral haemorrhage with finger-like projections (14 [39%] of 36 vs 0; p=0·043), and APOE ɛ4 possession (18 [50%] of 36 vs 2 [8%] of 26; p=0·0020). A prediction model for CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage using these three variables had excellent discrimination (c statistic 0·92, 95% CI 0·86–0·98), confirmed by internal validation. For the rule-out criteria, neither subarachnoid haemorrhage nor APOE ɛ4 possession had 100% sensitivity (95% CI 88–100). For the rule-in criteria, subarachnoid haemorrhage and either APOE ɛ4 possession or finger-like projections had 96% specificity (95% CI 78–100). Interpretation: The CT and APOE genotype prediction model for CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage shows excellent discrimination in this cohort, but requires external validation. The Edinburgh rule-in and rule-out diagnostic criteria might inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions that depend on identification of CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.

Background and purpose: Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases—encoded by ARS2 genes—are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that catalyse the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, ensuring the accuracy of the mitochondrial translation process. ARS2 gene mutations are associated with a wide range of clinical presentations affecting the CNS. Methods: Two senior neuroradiologists analysed brain MRI of 25 patients (age range: 3 d–25 yrs.; 11 males; 14 females) with biallelic pathogenic variants of 11 ARS2 genes in a retrospective study conducted between 2002 and 2019. Results: Though several combinations of brain MRI anomalies were highly suggestive of specific aetiologies (DARS2, EARS2, AARS2 and RARS2 mutations), our study detected no MRI pattern common to all patients. Stroke-like lesions were associated with pathogenic SARS2 and FARS2 variants. We also report early onset cerebellar atrophy and calcifications in AARS2 mutations, early white matter involvement in RARS2 mutations, and absent involvement of thalami in EARS2 mutations. Finally, our findings show that normal brain MRI results do not exclude the presence of ARS2 mutations: 5 patients with normal MRI images were carriers of pathogenic IARS2, YARS2, and FARS2 variants. Conclusion: Our study extends the spectrum of brain MRI anomalies associated with pathogenic ARS2 variants and suggests ARS2 mutations are largely underdiagnosed.', \"Pauses during Autobiographical Discourse Reflect Episodic Memory Processes in Early Alzheimer's Disease. There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some studies have focused on pause production, revealing that patients make extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been attributed to lexical retrieval difficulties, but pausing may also reflect other forms of cognitive impairment as it increases with cognitive load. The aim of the present study was to analyze autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective, looking at pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our first objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of these changes. Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD and 15 matched cognitively normal controls underwent an ecological episodic memory task, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. Autobiographical discourse collected from the ecological episodic memory task was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup comparisons showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than controls overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses. The number of these specific pauses was positively correlated with patients' episodic memory performance. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis showed that, in the patient group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar area (BA 10) grey matter density. This region may therefore play an important role in the planning of autobiographical discourse production. These findings demonstrate that pauses in early AD may reflect a compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel and memory retrieval.\", 'The neuroplasticity of division of labor: worker polymorphism, compound eye structure and brain organization in the leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes. Our understanding of how sensory structure design is coupled with neural processing capacity to adaptively support division of labor is limited. Workers of the remarkably polymorphic fungus-growing ant Atta cephalotes are behaviorally specialized by size: the smallest workers (minims) tend fungi in dark subterranean chambers while larger workers perform tasks outside the nest. Strong differences in worksite light conditions are predicted to influence sensory and processing requirements for vision. Analyzing confocal scans of worker eyes and brains, we found that eye structure and visual neuropils appear to have been selected to maximize task performance according to light availability. Minim eyes had few ommatidia, large interommatidial angles and eye parameter values, suggesting selection for visual sensitivity over acuity. Large workers had larger eyes with disproportionally more and larger ommatidia, and smaller interommatidial angles and eye parameter values, indicating peripheral sensory adaptation to ambient rainforest light. Optic lobes and mushroom body collars were disproportionately small in minims. Within the optic lobe, lamina and lobula relative volumes increased with worker size whereas medulla volume decreased. Visual system phenotypes thus correspond to task specializations in dark or light environments and illustrate a functional neuroplasticity underpinning division of labor in this socially complex agricultural ant.', 'Biallelic MYORG mutation carriers exhibit primary brain calcification with a distinct phenotype. Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurogenetic disorder with diverse neuropsychiatric expression. Mutations in four genes cause autosomal dominant PFBC: SLC20A2, XPR1, PDGFB and PDGFRB. Recently, biallelic mutations in the MYORG gene have been reported to cause PFBC with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. We screened MYORG in 29 unrelated probands negatively screened for the autosomal dominant PFBC genes and identified 11 families with a biallelic rare or novel predicted damaging variant. We studied the clinical and radiological features of 16 patients of these 11 families and compared them to that of 102 autosomal dominant PFBC patients carrying a mutation in one of the four known autosomal dominant PFBC genes. We found that MYORG patients exhibited a high clinical penetrance with a median age of onset of 52 years (range: 21-62) with motor impairment at the forefront. In particular, dysarthria was the presenting sign in 11/16 patients. In contrast to patients with autosomal dominant PFBC, 12/15 (80%) symptomatic patients eventually presented at least four of the following five symptoms: dysarthria, cerebellar syndrome, gait disorder of any origin, akinetic-hypertonic syndrome and pyramidal signs. In addition to the most severe clinical pattern, MYORG patients exhibited the most severe pattern of calcifications as compared to the patients from the four autosomal dominant PFBC gene categories. Strikingly, 12/15 presented with brainstem calcifications in addition to extensive calcifications in other brain areas (lenticular nuclei, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, ±cortex). Among them, eight patients exhibited pontine calcifications, which were observed in none of the autosomal dominant PFBC patients and hence appeared to be highly specific. Finally, all patients exhibited cerebellar atrophy with diverse degrees of severity on CT scans. We confirmed the existence of cerebellar atrophy by performing MRI voxel-based morphometry analyses of MYORG patients with autosomal dominant PFBC mutation carriers as a comparison group. Of note, in three families, the father carried small pallido-dentate calcifications while carrying the mutation at the heterozygous state, suggesting a putative phenotypic expression in some heterozygous carriers. In conclusion, we confirm that MYORG is a novel major PFBC causative gene and that the phenotype associated with such mutations may be recognized based on pedigree, clinical and radiological features.', 'Progress toward standardized diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment: Guidelines from the Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study. Introduction: Progress in understanding and management of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has been hampered by lack of consensus on diagnosis, reflecting the use of multiple different assessment protocols. A large multinational group of clinicians and researchers participated in a two-phase Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS) to agree on principles (VICCCS-1) and protocols (VICCCS-2) for diagnosis of VCI. We present VICCCS-2. Methods: We used VICCCS-1 principles and published diagnostic guidelines as points of reference for an online Delphi survey aimed at achieving consensus on clinical diagnosis of VCI. Results: Six survey rounds comprising 65–79 participants agreed guidelines for diagnosis of VICCCS-revised mild and major forms of VCI and endorsed the National Institute of Neurological Disorders–Canadian Stroke Network neuropsychological assessment protocols and recommendations for imaging. Discussion: The VICCCS-2 suggests standardized use of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders–Canadian Stroke Network recommendations on neuropsychological and imaging assessment for diagnosis of VCI so as to promote research collaboration.', 'Loss of the sphingolipid desaturase DEGS1 causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Sphingolipid imbalance is the culprit in a variety of neurological diseases, some affecting the myelin sheath. We have used whole-exome sequencing in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathies to uncover the endoplasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the causative gene in 19 patients from 13 unrelated families. Shared features among the cases include severe motor arrest, early nystagmus, dystonia, spasticity, and profound failure to thrive. MRI showed hypomyelination, thinning of the corpus callosum, and progressive thalamic and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 in myelin development and maintenance. This enzyme converts dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) in the final step of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. We detected a marked increase of the substrate DhCer and DhCer/Cer ratios in patients’ fibroblasts and muscle. Further, we used a knockdown approach for disease modeling in Danio rerio, followed by a preclinical test with the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya). The enzymatic inhibition of Cer synthase by fingolimod, 1 step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, reduced the critical DhCer/ Cer imbalance and the severe locomotor disability, increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in a zebrafish model. These proof-of-concept results pave the way to clinical translation.', 'Free water elimination improves test–retest reproducibility of diffusion tensor imaging indices in the brain: A longitudinal multisite study of healthy elderly subjects. Free water elimination (FWE) in brain diffusion MRI has been shown to improve tissue specificity in human white matter characterization both in health and in disease. Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test–retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55–80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects.

Over the past decades, MRI has become a major tool in the diagnosis and the follow-up of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), especially for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy. The recent international recommendations issued for the standardization of neurological and radiological clinical practices converge on many points. In this setting, recommendations made by the “Observatoire français de la sclérose en plaques”, the French MS registry, can be distinguished by its interdisciplinary complementarity, its longevity, its size, and its positions in direct connection with the clinic. Hence, after suspicions of gadolinium deposition in the brain, with multiple warning from the American and European health authorities, a national consultation took place and resulted in limitation to useful injections. The precautionary principle prevailing, the patient receives a limited quantity of contrast product even if no clinically harmful manifestation has been detected to date. The result of this round table bringing together neurologists and neuroradiologists from specialized centers was published in the form of a recommendation in early 2020. The interest of this project also lies in the constant improvement of the management of patients with MS and the possibility of developing advanced techniques to assist the clinician. The aim of this review is to explain to the neurologist, the interest of following this imaging protocol both in his/her clinical practice and in the possibilities that this opens up.', 'Postictal stereo-EEG changes following bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. ', 'Synchronous brain metastases as a poor prognosis factor in clear cell renal carcinoma: a strong argument for systematic brain screening. Purpose: Brain metastases (BM) usually represent a poor prognostic factor in solid tumors. About 10% of patients with renal cancer (RCC) will present BM. Local therapies such as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and surgery are used to achieve brain control. We compared survival between patients with synchronous BM (SynBM group) and metachronous BM (MetaBM group). Methods: It is a retrospective study of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and BM treated with TKI between 2005 and 2019 at the Centre Léon Bérard in Lyon. We collected prognostic factors: The International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk score, the TNM stage, the histological subtypes and the Fuhrman grade. Overall survival (OS) was defined from diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC to death. Brain progression-free survival (B-PFS) was defined from focal brain therapy to brain progression or death. Results: 99 patients were analyzed, 44 in the SynBM group and 55 in the MetaBM group. OS in the MetaBM group was 49.4\\xa0months versus 19.6\\xa0months in the SynBM group, p = 0.0002. The median time from diagnosis of metastasic disease to apparition of\\xa0BM in the MetaBM group was 22.9\\xa0months (4.3; 125.7). SRT was used for 101 lesions (66.4%), WBRT for 25 patients (16.4%), surgery for 21 lesions (13.8%), surgery followed by radiation for 5 lesions (3.3%). B-PFS for all patients was 7\\xa0months (IC95% [5.0–10.5]). Conclusions: Survival of patients with synchronous BM is inferior to that of patients with metachronous BM. Outcome is poor in both cases after diagnosis of BM. Brain screening should be encouraged at time of diagnosis of metastatis in ccRCC.', 'Can seizure therapies and noninvasive brain stimulations prevent suicidality? A systematic review. Background: Suicide is a major public health issue and the majority of those who attempt suicide suffer from mental disorders. Beyond psychopharmacotherapy, seizure therapies and noninvasive brain stimulation interventions have been used to treat such patients. However, the effect of these nonpharmacological treatments on the suicidal ideation and incidence of suicidality remains unclear. Here, we aimed to provide an update on the effects of seizure therapies and noninvasive brain stimulation on suicidality. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library databases using the MeSH terms “Electroconvulsive Therapy”, “Magnetic Seizure Stimulation”, “repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation”, “transcranial Direct Current Stimulation”, “Cranial Electrostimulation” and “suicide”. We included studies using seizure therapies and noninvasive brain stimulation as a main intervention that evaluated suicidality, regardless of diagnosis. Results: Among 1,019 records screened, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria using either electroconvulsive therapy (n\\xa0=\\xa014), magnetic seizure therapy (n\\xa0=\\xa02), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (n\\xa0=\\xa09), or transcranial direct current stimulation (n\\xa0=\\xa01). We observed that studies reported significant results, suggesting these techniques can be effective on the suicidal dimension of mental health pathologies, but a general statement regarding their efficacy is premature due to limitations. Conclusions: Future enquiry is necessary to address methodological limitations and evaluate the long-term efficacy of these methods both alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy.', 'Analysis of a subacute sclerosing panencephalitis genotype B3 virus from the 2009-2010 South African measles epidemic shows that hyperfusogenic F proteins contribute to measles virus infection in the brain. During a measles virus (MeV) epidemic in 2009 in South Africa, measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) was identified in several HIV-infected patients. Years later, children are presenting with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). To investigate the features of established MeV neuronal infections, viral sequences were analyzed from brain tissue samples of a single SSPE case and compared with MIBE sequences previously obtained from patients infected during the same epidemic. Both the SSPE and the MIBE viruses had amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of the F protein that confer enhanced fusion properties. Functional analysis of the fusion complexes confirmed that both MIBE and SSPE F protein mutations promoted fusion with less dependence on interaction by the viral receptor-binding protein with known MeV receptors. While the SSPE F required the presence of a homotypic attachment protein, MeV H, in order to fuse, MIBE F did not. Both F proteins had decreased thermal stability compared to that of the corresponding wild-type F protein. Finally, recombinant viruses expressing MIBE or SSPE fusion complexes spread in the absence of known MeV receptors, with MIBE F-bearing viruses causing large syncytia in these cells. Our results suggest that alterations to the MeV fusion complex that promote fusion and cell-to-cell spread in the absence of known MeV receptors is a key property for infection of the brain.', \"Mass spectrometry imaging identifies abnormally elevated brain l-DOPA levels and extrastriatal monoaminergic dysregulation in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. L-DOPA treatment for Parkinson's disease frequently leads to dyskinesias, the pathophysiology of which is poorly understood. We used MALDI-MSI to map the distribution of l-DOPA and monoaminergic pathways in brains of dyskinetic and nondyskinetic primates. We report elevated levels of l-DOPA, and its metabolite 3-O-methyldopa, in all measured brain regions of dyskinetic animals and increases in dopamine and metabolites in all regions analyzed except the striatum. In dyskinesia, dopamine levels correlated well with l-DOPA levels in extrastriatal regions, such as hippocampus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and cortical areas, but not in the striatum. Our results demonstrate that l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is linked to a dysregulation of l-DOPA metabolism throughout the brain. The inability of extrastriatal brain areas to regulate the formation of dopamine during l-DOPA treatment introduces the potential of dopamine or even l-DOPA itself to modulate neuronal signaling widely across the brain, resulting in unwanted side effects.\", 'Utility of post-therapy brain surveillance imaging in the detection of primary central nervous system lymphoma relapse. Background The optimal follow-up strategy for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients after first-line therapy is unclear. The goal of this study is to determine the utility of planned brain surveillance imaging in the detection of relapse in a retrospective cohort of PCNSL patients. Methods Patients were consecutive PCNSL cases treated in Leon Berard Cancer Centre, Lyon, France, from 1985 to 2011. Histology was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 94%. Patients were treated by methotrexate (92%) and cytarabine (63%) based-chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy for 108 patients (51%). Clinical records were reviewed for details at relapse and relationship to planned imaging. The imaging follow-up strategy was performed according to each treating physicians. Results Among 209 PCNSL patients, 127 complete response patients entered in post-treatment observation and 63 (50%) subsequently relapsed. Among the 125 evaluable patients, the majority of relapses (N\\xa0=\\xa049, 80%) was asymptomatic and identified before the planned brain imaging. Surveillance imaging detected relapses before symptoms in 12 patients who entered in post-therapy observation (10%). The median number of brain imaging during the follow-up was 7 (0–13). A total of 819 MRI/CT-scan were performed leading to the detection of 12 asymptomatic relapses. The one year OS rates were 41% and 58% for symptomatic and non-symptomatic relapses, respectively (P\\xa0=\\xa00.21). Conclusion The majority of PCNSL relapses occurred outside planned follow-up with no difference in patient outcome between symptomatic and asymptomatic relapses. The role of brain imaging for the detection of relapses in the follow-up of PCNSL patients remains to be clarified.', \"EEG-based brain-computer interfaces exploiting steady-state somatosensory-evoked potentials: A literature review. A brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to derive commands from the user's brain activity in order to relay them to an external device. To do so, it can either detect a spontaneous change in the mental state, in the so-called 'active' BCIs, or a transient or sustained change in the brain response to an external stimulation, in 'reactive' BCIs. In the latter, external stimuli are perceived by the user through a sensory channel, usually sight or hearing. When the stimulation is sustained and periodical, the brain response reaches an oscillatory steady-state that can be detected rather easily. We focus our attention on electroencephalography-based BCIs (EEG-based BCI) in which a periodical signal, either mechanical or electrical, stimulates the user skin. This type of stimulus elicits a steady-state response of the somatosensory system that can be detected in the recorded EEG. The oscillatory and phase-locked voltage component characterising this response is called a steady-state somatosensory-evoked potential (SSSEP). It has been shown that the amplitude of the SSSEP is modulated by specific mental tasks, for instance when the user focuses their attention or not to the somatosensory stimulation, allowing the translation of this variation into a command. Actually, SSSEP-based BCIs may benefit from straightforward analysis techniques of EEG signals, like reactive BCIs, while allowing self-paced interaction, like active BCIs. In this paper, we present a survey of scientific literature related to EEG-based BCI exploiting SSSEP. Firstly, we endeavour to describe the main characteristics of SSSEPs and the calibration techniques that allow the tuning of stimulation in order to maximise their amplitude. Secondly, we present the signal processing and data classification algorithms implemented by authors in order to elaborate commands in their SSSEP-based BCIs, as well as the classification performance that they evaluated on user experiments.\", 'Neurodevelopmental phenotype associated with CHD8-SUPT16H duplication. Microdeletions encompassing 14q11.2 locus, involving SUPT16H and CHD8, were shown to cause developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and macrocephaly. Variations leading to CHD8 haploinsufficiency or loss of function were also shown to lead to a similar phenotype. Recently, a 14q11.2 microduplication syndrome, encompassing CHD8 and SUPT16H, has been described, highlighting the importance of a tight control of at least CHD8 gene-dosage for a normal development. There have been only a few reports of 14q11.2 microduplications. Patients showed variable neurodevelopmental issues of variable severity. Breakpoints of the microduplications were non-recurrent, making interpretation of the CNV and determination of their clinical relevance difficult. Here, we report on two patients with 14q11.2 microduplication encompassing CHD8 and SUPT16H, one of whom had normal intelligence. Review of previous reports describing patients with comparable microduplications allowed for a more precise delineation of the condition and widening of the phenotypic spectrum.', 'Activity in the rat olfactory cortex is correlated with behavioral response to odor: a microPET study. How olfactory cortical areas interpret odor maps evoked in the olfactory bulb and translate odor information into behavioral responses is still largely unknown. Indeed, rat olfactory cortices encompass an extensive network located in the ventral part of the brain, thus complicating the use of invasive functional methods. In vivo imaging techniques that were previously developed for brain activation studies in humans have been adapted for use in rodents and facilitate the non-invasive mapping of the whole brain. In this study, we report an initial series of experiments designed to demonstrate that microPET is a powerful tool to investigate the neural processes underlying odor-induced behavioral response in a large-scale olfactory neuronal network. After the intravenous injection of [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), awake rats were placed in a ventilated Plexiglas cage for 50\\xa0min, where odorants were delivered every 3\\xa0min for a 10-s duration in a random order. Individual behavioral responses to odor were classified into categories ranging from 1 (head movements associated with a short sniffing period in response to a few stimulations) to 4 (a strong reaction, including rearing, exploring and sustained sniffing activity, to several stimulations). After [18F]FDG uptake, rats were anesthetized to perform a PET scan. This experimental session was repeated 2\\xa0weeks later using the same animals without odor stimulation to assess the baseline level of activation in each individual. Two voxel-based statistical analyses (SPM 8) were performed: (1) a two-sample paired t test analysis contrasting baseline versus odor scan and (2) a correlation analysis between voxel FDG activity and behavioral score. As expected, the contrast analysis between baseline and odor session revealed activations in various olfactory cortical areas. Significant increases in glucose metabolism were also observed in other sensory cortical areas involved in whisker movement and in several modules of the cerebellum involved in motor and sensory function. Correlation analysis provided new insight into these results. [18F]FDG uptake was correlated with behavioral response in a large part of the anterior piriform cortex and in some lobules of the cerebellum, in agreement with the previous data showing that both piriform cortex and cerebellar activity in humans can be driven by sniffing activity, which was closely related to the high behavioral scores observed in our experiment. The present data demonstrate that microPET imaging offers an original perspective for rat behavioral neuroimaging.', 'Differential Processing by Two Olfactory Subsystems in the Honeybee Brain. Among insects, Hymenoptera present a striking olfactory system with a clear neural dichotomy from the periphery to higher order centers, based on two main tracts of second-order (projection) neurons: the medial and lateral antennal lobe tracts (m-ALT and l-ALT). Despite substantial work on this dual pathway, its exact function is yet unclear. Here, we ask how attributes of odor quality and odor quantity are represented in the projection neurons (PNs) of the two pathways. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we compared the responses of m-ALT and l-ALT PNs of the honey bee Apis mellifera to a panel of 16 aliphatic odorants, and to three chosen odorants at eight concentrations. The results show that each pathway conveys differential information about odorants’ chemical features or concentration to higher order centers. While the l-ALT primarily conveys information about odorants’ chain length, the m-ALT informs about odorants’ functional group. Furthermore, each tract can only predict chemical distances or bees’ behavioral responses for odorants that differ according to its main feature, chain length or functional group. Generally l-ALT neurons displayed more graded dose–response relationships than m-ALT neurons, with a correspondingly smoother progression of inter-odor distances with increasing concentration. Comparison of these results with previous data recorded at AL input reveals differential processing by local networks within the two pathways. These results support the existence of parallel processing of odorant features in the insect brain.', 'White matter hyperintensities across the adult lifespan: Relation to age, Aβ load, and cognition. Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are very frequent in older adults and associated with worse cognitive performance. Little is known about the links between WMH and vascular risk factors, cortical β-amyloid (Aβ) load, and cognition in cognitively unimpaired adults across the entire lifespan, especially in young and middle-aged adults. Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven cognitively unimpaired adults from the community were enrolled (IMAP cohort). Participants underwent (i) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory, processing speed, working memory, and executive functions; (ii) brain structural T1 and FLAIR MRI scans used for the automatic segmentation of total and regional (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and corpus callosum) WMH; and (iii) a Florbetapir-PET scan to measure cortical Aβ. The relationships of total and regional WMH to age, vascular risk factors, cortical Aβ, and cognition were assessed within the whole sample, but also splitting the sample in two age groups (≤ or > 60 years old). Results: WMH increased with age across the adult lifespan, i.e., even in young and middle-aged adults. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin were all associated with higher WMH before, but not after, adjusting for age and the other vascular risk factors. Higher frontal, temporal, and occipital WMH were associated with greater Aβ, but this association was no longer significant when adjusting for age and vascular risk factors. Higher total and frontal WMH were associated with worse performance in executive functions, with no interactive effect of the age group. In contrast, there was a significant interaction of the age group on the link between WMH and working memory, which was significant within the subgroup of young/middle-aged adults only. Adding cortical Aβ load in the models did not alter the results, and there was no interaction between WMH and Aβ on cognition. Conclusion: WMH increased with age and were associated with worse executive functions across the adult lifespan and with worse working memory in young/middle-aged adults. Aβ load was weakly associated with WMH and did not change the relationship found between WMH and executive functions. This study argues for the clinical relevance of WMH across the adult lifespan, even in young and middle-aged adults with low WMH.', \"Uric acid and incident dementia over 12 years of follow-up: A population-based cohort study. Objectives In patients with gout, maintaining too low serum uric acid (SUA) level with urate-lowering therapy is a concern because uric acid is thought to be neuroprotective. However, the relation between SUA and dementia remains debated. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SUA level on the incidence of dementia. Methods We assessed the longitudinal association between SUA level and incident dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV (DSM-IV) criteria) in a large cohort of healthy older people from the community (Three-City Dijon cohort). Additionally, we investigated the relation between SUA level and MRI markers of brain ageing (white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), lacunes and hippocampal volume). Results The study sample comprised 1598 people (mean (SD) age 72.4(4.1) years, 38.3% male). During the 13,357 person-years of follow-up (median duration: 10.1 years), dementia developed in 110 participants (crude incidence rate: 8.2/1000 person-years). After multiple adjustments, the multivariate HR with the highest (≥75th percentile) versus lowest SUA level was 1.79 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.73; p=0.007). The association was stronger with vascular or mixed dementia (HR=3.66 (95% CI 1.29 to 10.41), p=0.015) than Alzheimer's disease (HR=1.55 (95% CI 0.92 to 2.61), p=0.10). There was a non-significant trend towards an association between high SUA level and extensive WMHV (p=0.10), a biomarker of small vessel disease, but not hippocampal volume (p=0.94) or lacunes (p=0.86). The association between SUA level and vascular or mixed dementia might be affected by interim strokes. Conclusions Risk of dementia, especially vascular or mixed dementia, may be increased with high SUA levels in elderly people.\", 'Perinatal dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain development, role in neurodevelopmental disorders. n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids that are provided by dietary intake. Growing evidence suggests that n-3 and n-6 PUFAs are paramount for brain functions. They constitute crucial elements of cellular membranes, especially in the brain. They are the precursors of several metabolites with different effects on inflammation and neuron outgrowth. Overall, long-chain PUFAs accumulate in the offspring brain during the embryonic and post-natal periods. In this review, we discuss how they accumulate in the developing brain, considering the maternal dietary supply, the polymorphisms of genes involved in their metabolism, and the differences linked to gender. We also report the mechanisms linking their bioavailability in the developing brain, their transfer from the mother to the embryo through the placenta, and their role in brain development. In addition, data on the potential role of altered bioavailability of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in the etiologies of neurodevelopmental diseases, such as autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, are reviewed.', 'Immune cell regulation of glia during CNS injury and disease. Glial cells are abundant in the CNS and are essential for brain development and homeostasis. These cells also regulate tissue recovery after injury and their dysfunction is a possible contributing factor to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disease. Recent evidence suggests that microglia, which are also the brain’s major resident immune cells, provide disease-modifying regulation of the other major glial populations, namely astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In addition, peripheral immune cells entering the CNS after injury and in disease may directly affect microglial, astrocyte and oligodendrocyte function, suggesting an integrated network of immune cell–glial cell communication.', 'Accumulation of\\xa0amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments triggers mitochondrial structure, function, and mitophagy defects in Alzheimer’s disease models and human brains. Several lines of recent evidence indicate that the amyloid precursor protein-derived C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) could correspond to an etiological trigger of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Altered mitochondrial homeostasis is considered an early event in AD development. However, the specific contribution of APP-CTFs to mitochondrial structure, function, and mitophagy defects remains to be established. Here, we demonstrate in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing either APP Swedish mutations, or the β-secretase-derived APP-CTF fragment (C99) combined with β- and γ-secretase inhibition, that APP-CTFs accumulation independently of Aβ triggers excessive mitochondrial morphology alteration (i.e., size alteration and cristae disorganization) associated with enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. APP-CTFs accumulation also elicit basal mitophagy failure illustrated by enhanced conversion of LC3, accumulation of LC3-I and/or LC3-II, non-degradation of SQSTM1/p62, inconsistent Parkin and PINK1 recruitment to mitochondria, enhanced levels of membrane and matrix mitochondrial proteins, and deficient fusion of mitochondria with lysosomes. We confirm the contribution of APP-CTFs accumulation to morphological mitochondria alteration and impaired basal mitophagy in vivo in young 3xTgAD transgenic mice treated with γ-secretase inhibitor as well as in adeno-associated-virus-C99 injected mice. Comparison of aged 2xTgAD and 3xTgAD mice indicates that, besides APP-CTFs, an additional contribution of Aβ to late-stage mitophagy activation occurs. Importantly, we report on mitochondrial accumulation of APP-CTFs in human post-mortem sporadic AD brains correlating with mitophagy failure molecular signature. Since defective mitochondria homeostasis plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis, targeting mitochondrial dysfunctions and/or mitophagy by counteracting early APP-CTFs accumulation may represent relevant therapeutic interventions in AD.', \"The incidence of post-mortem neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in mixed dementia. Background The clinical picture of dementia in most aged patients is due to a combination of different neurodegenerative processes and frequently associated to cerebrovascular lesions. They are called mixed dementia (MixD) cases, to be differentiated from those with pure vascular dementia (VaD) and those with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The present study compares the frequency of different associated lesions in these disease groups. Materials and methods Out of a series of 252 autopsied patients 36 with MixD, 20 with VaD and 64 with AD disease were compared concerning the frequency of the associated lesions. Small cerebrovascular lesions were evaluated on a large coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere. Mean values of frequency and severity were compared between the 3 groups. Results Of the 120 examined brains 30% were classified as MixD, 17% as VaD and 53% as AD. In 20% of the AD patients Lewy body pathology (LBP) was observed with a low incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, except for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The MixD patients had more severe CAA and were significantly older than those with VaD and AD. Lacunar infarcts, on the other hand, were significantly more frequent in the VaD patients. Discussion The most responsible vascular lesions in MixD and VaD are different. There is an inverse correlation between the presence of LBP and vascular pathology. MixD has to be considered as the end stage of AD.\", 'Safety evaluation of frequent application of microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound blood-brain-barrier opening. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles induces blood brain barrier (BBB) opening in targeted areas and facilitates drug delivery. However, recent studies have indicated that FUS-BBB opening with excessive exposure levels may be associated with inflammatory response and cellular/tissue damage. Multiple weekly FUS exposures have been shown to be safe for human subjects. However the effect of more frequent FUS exposures is still unknown. This study examines whether frequent focused ultrasound blood brain barrier opening is associated with aggravated behavioral, histopathologic change or brain tissue damage. Two protocols of focused ultrasound blood brain barrier opening were devised using different microbubble doses (0.15 µl/kg and 0.4 µl/kg). Focused ultrasound exposure at a threshold level of BBB-opening, below-threshold level, or above level for intracerebral hemorrhage were delivered every 2 days. Animal behavioral and physiological changes were examined and recorded. Brain tissue was examined for hemorrhage and apoptosis. Results indicate that frequent exposure of excessive focused ultrasound (1.4 mechanical index) produced minor and short-term behavioral changes despite significant tissue damage, while frequent BBB opening with threshold or below-threshold FUS exposure (0.33–0.8 mechanical index) did not cause behavioral or histological change. Immunofluorescent examination of rat brain tissue indicated that excessive doses of microbubble administration induce an apparent cellular apoptotic response, which may be exacerbated by intracerebral hemorrhage. Experimental results suggest that frequent focused ultrasound blood brain barrier opening with sufficient ultrasound exposure level and a microbubble dose can be safe and pose minimal risk to brain tissue.', 'Cerebral autoregulation in migraine with aura: A case control study. Background: Migraine with aura is independently associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in younger subjects. This association might be related to an impairment of cerebral autoregulation, which normally maintains cerebral blood flow independent of arterial blood pressure variations. Methods: Patients aged 30–55, fulfilling ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine with aura, were prospectively enrolled and compared with gender- and age-matched healthy controls without a history of migraine. Patients and controls with a history of stroke or any disease potentially impairing cerebral autoregulation were excluded. We assessed cerebral autoregulation with two different methods: Transfer function analysis, and the correlation coefficient index Mx. The transfer function phase and gain reflect responses of cerebral blood flow velocities to relatively fast fluctuations of arterial blood pressure, whereas Mx also reflects responses to slower arterial blood pressure fluctuations. Results: A total of 22 migraine with aura patients (median age [IQR]: 39.5 [12.5] years) and 22 controls (39 [9.75] years) were included. Transfer function parameters and Mx were not different between patients and controls. However, Mx was inversely correlated with age in patients (ρ = −0.567, p = 0.006) and not in controls (ρ = −0.084, p = 0.509). Mx was also inversely correlated with migraine with aura duration (ρ = −0.617, p = 0.002), suggesting improvement of cerebral autoregulation efficiency with disease duration. Conclusions: Cerebral autoregulation did not differ between patients and controls aged 30–55. However, cerebral autoregulation efficiency was strongly correlated with migraine with aura duration. Further studies in younger patients are needed to determine whether cerebral autoregulation is impaired early in the course of disease. Trial Registration: NCT02708797.', 'In vivo localization of cortical areas using a 3D computerized atlas of the marmoset brain. We created a volumetric template of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain, which enables localization of the cortical areas defined in the Paxinos et al. (The marmoset brain in stereotaxic coordinates. Elsevier Academic Press, Cambridge, 2012) marmoset brain atlas, as well as seven broader cortical regions (occipital, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, motor, limbic, insular), different brain compartments (white matter, gray matter, cerebro-spinal fluid including ventricular spaces), and various other structures (brain stem, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus). The template was designed from T1-weighted MR images acquired using a 3 T MRI scanner. It was based on a single fully segmented marmoset brain image, which was transported onto the mean of 13 adult marmoset brain images using a diffeomorphic strategy that fully preserves the brain topology. In addition, we offer an automatic segmentation pipeline which fully exploits the proposed template. The segmentation pipeline was quantitatively assessed by comparing the results of manual and automated segmentations. An associated program, written in Python, can be used from a command-line interface, or used interactively as a module of the 3DSlicer software. This program can be applied to the analysis of multimodal images, to map specific cortical areas in lesions or to define the seeds for further tractography analyses.', 'Associations between white matter hyperintensities and cognitive decline over three years in non-dementia older adults with memory complaints. We investigated whether the baseline level and overtime changes of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) would be associated with cognitive decline over three years in non-demented older adults with memory complaints. 109 participants with baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and follow-up cognitive assessments up to 3-year were included; among them, 82 also had a follow-up MRI assessment over three years. WMH volume was obtained by an automated segmentation algorithm. Baseline WMH volumes and change between baseline and follow-up WMH were related to cognitive scores over time using mixed-effect linear regressions. Secondary stratified analyses according to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) status, APOE4 status, and presence of amyloid in the brain were conducted using similar regression models. Change in WMH volume overtime was associated with declines in COWAT (β\\xa0=\\xa0−\\xa00.239; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa0−\\xa00.381, −\\xa00.096, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001). Baseline WMH was not associated to any of the cognitive tests. Secondary analysis found that baseline WMH was associated to declines in TMT-A in APOE4 non-carriers (β\\xa0=\\xa00.343; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.121, 0.564, p\\xa0=\\xa00.003) and CDR 0 groups (β\\xa0=\\xa00.307; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.095, 0.519, p\\xa0=\\xa00.005); in CDR 0 group, overtime changes in WMH was associated to declines on both TMT-A (β\\xa0=\\xa00.698; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.270, 1.126, p\\xa0=\\xa00.002) and TMT-B (β\\xa0=\\xa02.573; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa01.200, 3.947, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Changes in WMH volume are associated with declines in information processing speed and executive function in non-demented older adults with memory complaints. Overtime changes in WMH volume is probably a better determinant of cognitive function in the elderly than baseline WMH volume.', 'Will This Patient Need to Be Admitted to the ICU After Supratentoral Brain Tumor Resection? A Hard Nut to Crack. ', 'Magnetic resonance imaging does not reveal structural alterations in the brain of grapheme-color synesthetes. Several publications have reported structural changes in the brain of synesthetes compared to controls, either local differences or differences in connectivity. In the present study, we pursued this quest for structural brain differences that might support the subjective experience of synesthesia. In particular, for the first time in this field, we investigated brain folding in comparing 45 sulcal shapes in each hemisphere of control and grapheme-color synesthete populations. To overcome flaws relative to data interpretation based only on p-values, common in the synesthesia literature, we report confidence intervals of effect sizes. Moreover, our statistical maps are displayed without introducing the classical, but misleading, p-value level threshold. We adopt such a methodological procedure to facilitate appropriate data interpretation and promote the “New Statistics” approach. Based on structural or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data, we did not find any strong cerebral anomaly, in sulci, tissue volume, tissue density or fiber organization that could support synesthetic color experience. Finally, by sharing our complete datasets, we strongly support the multi-center construction of a sufficient large dataset repository for detecting, if any, subtle brain differences that May help understanding how a subjective experience, such as synesthesia, is mentally constructed.', 'Punctate pattern. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of the punctate pattern (PP) for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Methods: A cohort of 20 consecutive patients with PML, related to natalizumab (NTZ) (n 14) or not (n 6), underwent 3T MRI (147 MRI examinations). MRI was available at presymptomatic (n 9 patients), symptomatic (n 15), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and chronic stages (n 20). A pathologic control group of patients without PML (n 80), with clinically definitive multiple sclerosis or a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of CNS demyelination, underwent the same MRI protocol. Number and appearance of punctate lesions were assessed by 3 blinded readers using T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and postcontrast T1-weighted images. Results: Interobserver agreement was good ( 0.79) (0.72-0.87). Of the 20 patients with PML, 18 had PP, including the 14 patients with NTZ-PML; none in the pathologic control group. Of the 9 presymptomatic patients with NTZ-PML, PP was observed in 7 (78% sensitive and 100% specific). Nonenhancing PP on T2-weighted/FLAIR images was detected in 13 patients with PML, exclusively at the presymptomatic or symptomatic stages (including 7 NTZ-PML), whereas enhancing PP occurred in 16 patients with PML, including 13 of the 14 patients with NTZ-PML at the IRIS stage. Conclusions: PP is a highly specific feature of PML and may be the first imaging feature at the presymptomatic stage with potential implications in patient care. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that a PP on MRI accurately identifies patients with NTZ-PML.', \"Cognitive explanations of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: An inventory of the scientific literature. Aims: Our article consists in both analysis and synthesis of contemporary cognitive models of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia. Our work is based on the analysis of the scientific literature including original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis. Methodology: In order to identify the most pertinent studies in the electronic search, the three following databases were systematically searched: PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. For both the analysis and synthesis we selected original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis referring to any cognitive explanation of the auditory hallucinatory experience in schizophrenia. A cognitive model of auditory hallucinations refers to any incorporation of cognitive frameworks and explanations in one's conceptualization of the hallucinatory phenomenon in schizophrenia. We also focused our work on past conceptualization of auditory hallucinations in order to explain the development and the contribution of current cognitive models in the understanding of the onset and the maintaining of AVHs. After a brief review of clinical characteristics and historical conceptualization of auditory verbal hallucinations, contemporary explanations were presented in the area of schizophrenia. These explanations referred to researches into cognitive psychopathology including metacognitive as well as neuroimaging studies. Results: The examination of scientific literature highlighted the complexity of AVHs through multifactorial explanations here mostly explained by cognitive and metacognitive deficits. We synthesized former conceptualizations of AVHs, which were sustained on mechanistic or sensory explanations. Esquirol, Baillarger and Briere de Boismont were the first as conceiving AVHs as a perception disorder and introduced the idea that auditory hallucinations resulted from a failure to control one's memories/fantasies. Later, Broca and Wernicke discovered auditory areas in the human brain implicated in language comprehension and production. AVHs began to be conceptualized by the scientific world as being mechanistically brain-related. Sigmund Freud was among the first to study the meaning of AVHs, a domain still being investigated by todays cognitive sciences. More recently, neuroimaging studies allowed the validation of these sensory explanations in considering the onset of AVHs through the deficit of cortical and subcortical areas implicated in the process of languages (e.g. Broca and Wernicke areas) and emotions (e.g. limbic system, amygdala, hippocampus). At a more mechanistic level, contemporary cognitive models of AVHs explained AVHs as an intrusive verbal representation into the awareness which is non-inhibited (i.e. deficit in intentional inhibition) and also non-recognized as one's own experience (i.e. deficit in source monitoring, planning and metacognition), or even attributed to an external source (attribution bias). In terms of inhibitory control, inhibition is a basic cognitive mechanism defined as a collection of processes that allows the suppression of previously activated cognitive contents and the clearing of irrelevant actions or attention from consciousness. Intentional inhibition is effortful and occurs when an individual deliberately suppresses the activation of an item after deciding it is irrelevant. Theoretical support for the suggestion that an inhibitory failure is involved in AVHs in schizophrenia arises from studies that have shown that a failure in inhibition results in intrusive thoughts from long-term memory. Recent findings also found that individuals with AVHs in schizophrenia demonstrated an impaired source monitoring. In episodic memory research, a distinction was made between content (an event) and context (e.g. source or temporal characteristics of an event) information. The context of memories provides cues that allow an individual to differentiate one memory from other memories. AVHs are conceptualized as a failure to access the contextual cues that would allow voice-hearer to form an intact representation of events in memories. Regarding planning, AVHs refer to the intrusion of unwanted memories into the inner speech that are not recognized from one's own representation. Previous cognitive theories highlighted the important role played by metacognitive skills and belief (i.e. thinking about one's thinking) in the explanation of AVHs. Finally, the external attribution bias was extensively studied over the last three decades and refers to the tendency to attribute negative events (situational or cognitive) to an external source. In this framework, AVHs refer to intrusive thoughts externally attributed to a voice. Conclusion: For more than one century, scientific discoveries in (bio)medical science have allowed the validation of former sensory and mechanistic explanations of AVHs. Nevertheless, many explanatory models account for the way AVHs are maintained (source monitoring, deficit in planning, externalizing bias), while they scarcely expose how they are triggered (intrusive thoughts, deficit in inhibition). The relation between AVHs and intrusive thoughts still remain unclear, and further studies are needed for the understanding of a potential causal relationship.\", \"Brain Amyloid Deposition is Associated With Lower Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Abilities in Older Adults. Results from the MAPT Study. Background. Brain amyloid deposition is one of the key pathological hallmarks underlying the cognitive changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Growing interest has been given to the earliest clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques. However, the relationship between amyloid status and activities of everyday function remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the relationship between instrumental activities of daily living performance (using the ADL-PI score) and amyloid status in older adults. Methods. Cross-sectional analyses of data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) were performed. Volunteers underwent a brain 18F-AV45 positron emission tomography examination. Bivariate analysis and regression models were conducted to study the relationships between brain amyloid deposition and the total ADL-PI score. Results. We included 271 participants (women = 60%; age = 76±4 years). Amyloid positron emission tomography was positive (standard uptake value ≥1.17) for 103 participants (38%). The ADL-PI score was lower in amyloid positive participants than in their amyloid negative counterparts (38.8 vs 40.3, p =. 007). This association was also confirmed in regression models adjusted for age, gender, and familial history of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.99; p =. 02). This finding was consistent in cognitively normal individuals and in those with mild cognitive impairment, using the clinical dementia rating scale. Conclusions. This study highlighted an association between early functional limitations and brain amyloid deposition in elderly subjects. These symptoms could be the clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques even in the absence of overt dementia. Further prospective studies are warranted for examining the evolution of ADL-PI score over the course of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"Reward and decision processes in the brains of humans and nonhuman primates. Choice behavior requires weighing multiple decision variables, such as utility, uncertainty, delay, or effort, that combine to define a subjective value for each considered option or course of action. This capacity is based on prior learning about potential rewards (and punishments) that result from prior actions. When made in a social context, decisions can involve strategic thinking about the intentions of others and about the impact of others' behavior on one's own outcome. Valuation is also influenced by different emotions that serve to adaptively regulate our choices in order to, for example, stay away from excessively risky gambles, prevent future regrets, or avoid personal rejection or conflicts. Drawing on economic theory and on advances in the study of neuronal mechanisms, we review relevant recent experiments in nonhuman primates and clinical observations made in neurologically impaired patients suffering from impaired decision-making capacities.\", 'Bimodal distribution of tone-matching deficits indicates discrete pathophysiological entities within the syndrome of schizophrenia. To date, no measures are available that permit differentiation of discrete, clinically distinct subtypes of schizophrenia (SZ) with potential differential underlying pathophysiologies. Over recent years, there has been increasing recognition that SZ is heterogeneously associated with deficits in early auditory processing (EAP), as demonstrated using clinically applicable tasks such as tone-matching task (TMT). Here, we pooled TMT performances across 310 SZ individuals and 219 healthy controls (HC), along with clinical, cognitive, and resting-state functional-connectivity MRI (rsFC-MRI) measures. In addition, TMT was measured in a group of 24 patients at symptomatic clinical high risk (CHR) for SZ and 24 age-matched HC (age range 7–27 years). We provide the first demonstration that the EAP deficits are bimodally distributed across SZ subjects (P < 0.0001 vs. unimodal distribution), with one group showing entirely unimpaired TMT performance (SZ-EAP+), and a second showing an extremely large TMT impairment (SZ-EAP−), relative to both controls (d = 2.1) and SZ-EAP+ patients (d = 3.4). The SZ-EAP− group predominated among samples drawn from inpatient sites, showed higher levels of cognitive symptoms (PANSS), worse social cognition and a differential deficit in neurocognition (MATRICS battery), and reduced functional capacity. rsFC-MRI analyses showed significant reduction in SZ-EAP− relative to controls between subcortical and cortical auditory regions. As opposed to SZ, CHR patients showed intact EAP function. In HC age-matched to CHR, EAP ability was shown to increase across the age range of vulnerability preceding SZ onset. These results indicate that EAP measure segregates between discrete SZ subgroups. As TMT can be readily implemented within routine clinical settings, its use may be critical to account for the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes currently observed across SZ patients, as well as for pre-clinical detection and efficacious treatment selection.', \"Dysfunction of serotonergic neurons in Parkinson's disease and dyskinesia. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the depletion of striatal dopamine and the presence of Lewy aggregates containing alpha-synuclein. Clinically, there are motor impairments involving cardinal movement symptoms, bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and postural abnormalities, along with non-motor symptoms such as sleep, behavior and mood disorders. The current treatment for PD focuses on restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa), which loses therapeutic efficacy and induces disabling abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) after several years. Evidence indicates that the pathophysiology of both PD and LID disorders is also associated with the dysfunctional activity of the serotonergic (5-HT) neurons that may be responsible for motor and non-motor disturbances. The main population of 5-HT neurons is located in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN), which provides extensive innervation to almost the entire neuroaxis and controls multiple functions in the brain. The degeneration of DRN 5-HT neurons occurs in early PD. These neurons can also take exogenous levodopa to transform it into dopamine, which may disturb neuron activity. This review will provide an overview of the underlying mechanisms responsible for 5-HT dysfunction and its clinical relevance in PD and dyskinesia.\", \"Impact of speller size on a visual P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) system under two conditions of constraint for eye movement. The vast majority of P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are based on the well-known P300 speller presented by Farwell and Donchin for communication purposes and an alternative to people with neuromuscular disabilities, such as impaired eye movement. The purpose of the present work is to study the effect of speller size on P300-based BCI usability, measured in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction under overt and covert attention conditions. To this end, twelve participants used three speller sizes under both attentional conditions to spell 12 symbols. The results indicated that the speller size had, in both attentional conditions, a significant influence on performance. In both conditions (covert and overt), the best performances were obtained with the small and medium speller sizes, both being the most effective. The speller size did not significantly affect workload on the three speller sizes. In contrast, covert attention condition produced very high workload due to the increased resources expended to complete the task. Regarding users' preferences, significant differences were obtained between speller sizes. The small speller size was considered as the most complex, the most stressful, the less comfortable, and the most tiring. The medium speller size was always considered in the medium rank, which is the speller size that was evaluated less frequently and, for each dimension, the worst one. In this sense, the medium and the large speller sizes were considered as the most satisfactory. Finally, the medium speller size was the one to which the three standard dimensions were collected: High effectiveness, high efficiency, and high satisfaction. This work demonstrates that the speller size is an important parameter to consider in improving the usability of P300 BCI for communication purposes. The obtained results showed that using the proposed medium speller size, performance and satisfaction could be improved.\", \"BIL&amp;GIN: A neuroimaging, cognitive, behavioral, and genetic database for the study of human brain lateralization. We report on a database, named BIL&GIN, designed for investigating the cognitive, behavioral, genetic, and brain morphological/functional correlates of hemispheric specialization. The database contains records from a sample of 453 adult participants enriched in left-handers (45%, N. =. 205) as compared to the general population. For each subject, socio-demographic data, hand and eye laterality, family handedness, and cognitive abilities in the language, motor, visuo-spatial, and numerical domains have been recorded. T1-MRI and DTI data were also acquired, as well as resting-state functional MRI. Task-evoked functional MRI was performed in a sub-sample of 303 subjects (157 left-handers) using a customized functional battery of 16 cognitive tasks exploring the same three cognitive domains. Performances at the tasks executed in the magnet as well as post-acquisition debriefing were recorded. A saliva sample was obtained from the subjects of this sub-sample from which DNA was extracted. The BIL&GIN contains results of imaging data processing for each subject, namely maps of tissue (GM, WM, CSF) probability, cortical thickness, cortical surface, and diffusion parameters as well as regional values of these phenotypes for regions of both AAL and FreeSurfer parcellations. For the subjects who underwent FMRI, individual SPM contrast maps for each of the 8 runs were also calculated and included in the database, as well as corresponding BOLD variations in ROIs of the AAL and AICHA atlases, and Wilke's hemispheric functional lateralization index. The BIL&GIN data sharing is based on a collaborative model.\", \"Lack of spontaneous age-related brain pathology in Octodon degus: A reappraisal of the model. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the degeneration of specific brain areas associated with accumulation of disease-related protein in extra-or intra-cellular deposits. Their preclinical investigations are mostly based on genetically-engineered animals. Despite their interest, these models are often based on high level of disease-related protein expression, thus questioning their relevance to human pathology and calling for the alternate use of ecological models. In the past few years, Octodon degus has emerged as a promising animal model displaying age-dependent Alzheimer's disease-related pathology. As neurodegenerative-related proteins often co-deposit in the brain of patients, we assessed the occurrence of α-synuclein-related pathology in this model using state-of-The-Art immunohistochemistry and biochemistry. Despite our efforts and in contrast with previously published results, our study argues against the use of Octodon degus as a suitable natural model of neurodegenerative disorder as we failed to identify either Parkinson's disease-or Alzheimer's disease-related brain pathologies.\", 'Role of cortical microbleeds in cognitive impairment: In\\xa0vivo behavioral and imaging characterization of a novel murine model. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) could contribute to cognitive impairment in the general population and in patients with dementia. We designed a study to (i) develop a murine model of CMBs, (ii) assess whether CMBs affect cognition in this model and (iii) assess whether this model is sensitive to pharmacological modulation. Male C57Bl6/J mice were stereotactically administered collagenase to induce cortical lesion analysed by MRI at 24 h. CMB-mice were assessed at six weeks post-lesion for cognitive performances (Barnes maze and Touchscreen automated paired-associated learning (PAL) task) and for cerebral metabolism (in\\xa0vivo PET/CT with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)). CMB-model sensitivity to pharmacological modulation was assessed by administering atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) over the follow-up period. CMB mice were compared to naïve littermates. Collagenase at 0.8 µU/µl appeared suitable to induce reproducible and reliable CMBs. At six weeks, a decline in learning, spatial and visuospatial memory was significantly observed in CMB-mice. Brain metabolism was impaired in all cortex, striatum and the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. A significant improvement in cognition performances was depicted under atorvastatin. In this novel murine model of CMBs, we validated that CMBs lowered cognitive performances and affected regional metabolism. We also proved that this CMB-model is sensitive to pharmacological modulation.', 'Surgical resection of cavernous angioma located within eloquent brain areas: International survey of the practical management among 19 specialized centers. Purpose: The practical management of cavernous angioma located within eloquent brain area before, during and after surgical resection is poorly documented. We assessed the practical pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative management of cavernous angioma located within eloquent brain area. Method: An online survey composed of 61 items was sent to 26 centers to establish a multicenter international retrospective cohort of adult patients who underwent a surgical resection as the first-line treatment of a supratentorial cavernous angioma located within or close to eloquent brain area. Results: 272 patients from 19 centers (mean 13.6 ± 16.7 per center) from eight countries were included. The pre-operative management varied significantly between centers and countries regarding the pre-operative functional assessment, the pre-operative epileptological assessment, the first given antiepileptic drug, and the time to surgery. The intra-operative environment varied significantly between centers and countries regarding the use of imaging systems, the use of functional mapping with direct electrostimulations, the extent of resection of the hemosiderin rim, the realization of a post-operative functional assessment, and the time to post-operative functional assessment. The present survey found a post-operative improvement, as compared to pre-operative evaluations, of the functional status, the ability to work, and the seizure control. Conclusions: We observed a variety of practice between centers and countries regarding the management of cavernous angioma located within eloquent regions. Multicentric prospective studies are required to solve relevant questions regarding the management of cavernous angioma-related seizures, the timing of surgery, and the optimal extent of hemosiderin rim resection.', \"N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is increased in autopsy specimens of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The pathomechanisms that associate a deficit in folate and/or vitamin B12 and the subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia with pathological brain ageing are unclear. We investigated the homocysteinylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, and in rats depleted in folate and vitamin B12, Cd320 KO mice with selective B12 brain deficiency and H19-7 neuroprogenitors lacking folate. Compared with controls, N-homocysteinylated tau and MAP1 were increased and accumulated in protein aggregates and tangles in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of patients and animals. N-homocysteinylation dissociated tau and MAPs from β-tubulin, and MS analysis showed that it targets lysine residues critical for their binding to β-tubulin. N-homocysteinylation increased in rats exposed to vitamin B12 and folate deficit during gestation and lactation and remained significantly higher when they became 450 days-old, despite returning to normal diet at weaning, compared with controls. It was correlated with plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and brain expression of methionine tRNAsynthetase (MARS), the enzyme required for the synthesis of Hcy–thiolactone, the substrate of N-homocysteinylation. Experimental inactivation of MARS prevented the N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1, and the dissociation of tau and MAP1 from β-tubulin and PSD95 in cultured neuroprogenitors. In conclusion, increased N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is a mechanism of brain ageing that depends on Hcy concentration and expression of MARS enzyme. Its irreversibility and cumulative occurrence throughout life may explain why B12 and folate supplementation of the elderly has limited effects, if any, to prevent pathological brain ageing and cognitive decline.

Using knockout (KO) mice lacking the histamine (HA)-synthesizing enzyme (histidine decarboxylase, HDC), we have previously shown the importance of histaminergic neurons in maintaining wakefulness (W) under behavioral challenges. Since the central actions of HA are mediated by several receptor subtypes, it remains to be determined which one(s) could be responsible for such a role. We have therefore compared the cortical-EEG, sleep and W under baseline conditions or behavioral/pharmacological stimuli in littermate wild-type (WT) and H1-receptor KO (H1-/-) mice. We found that H1-/- mice shared several characteristics with HDC KO mice, i.e. 1) a decrease in W after lights-off despite its normal baseline daily amount; 2) a decreased EEG slow wave sleep (SWS)/W power ratio; 3) inability to maintain W in response to behavioral challenges demonstrated by a decreased sleep latency when facing various stimuli. These effects were mediated by central H1-receptors. Indeed, in WT mice, injection of triprolidine, a brain-penetrating H1-receptor antagonist increased SWS, whereas ciproxifan (H3-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist) elicited W; all these injections had no effect in H1-/- mice. Finally, H1-/- mice showed markedly greater changes in EEG power (notably in the 0.8-5 Hz band) and sleep-wake cycle than in WT mice after application of a cholinergic antagonist or an indirect agonist, i.e., scopolamine or physostigmine. Hence, the role of HA in wake-promotion is largely ensured by H1-receptors. An upregulated cholinergic system may account for a quasi-normal daily amount of W in HDC or H1-receptor KO mice and likely constitutes a major compensatory mechanism when the brain is facing deficiency of an activating system.

The accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in multiple brain regions is a neuropathological hallmark of synucleinopathies. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a synucleinopathy characterized by the predominant cerebral accumulation of aggregated α-syn as cytoplasmic glial inclusions (CGI). A premortem diagnosis tool would improve early diagnosis and help monitoring disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. One Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study suggested [ 11 C]BF-227 as a promising radiotracer for monitoring intracellular α-syn deposition in MSA patients. We sought to confirm the binding of this radiotracer to α-syn using state-of-the-art autoradiography. Medulla sections were obtained from 9 MSA patients and 9 controls (London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank). [ 18 F]BF-227, chemically identical to [ 11 C]BF-227, was used at nanomolar concentrations to perform in vitro autoradiography assays. Autoradiograms were superimposed on fluorescent staining from the conformational anti-α-syn antibody 5G4 and quantified after immunofluorescence-driven definition of regions of interest. Autoradiography showed no specific signals in MSA patients in comparison to controls despite widespread pathology detected by immunofluorescence. Autoradiography does not support a significant binding of [ 18 F]BF-227 to CGI at concentrations typically achieved in PET experiments.', 'Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Free and Esterified Oxygenated Derivatives from Docosahexaenoic Acid in Rat Brain. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent long-chain fatty acid of the omega-3 family, is present at high amount in brain tissues, especially in membrane phospholipids. This polyunsaturated fatty acid is the precursor of various oxygenated lipid mediators involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes. Characterization of DHA-oxygenated metabolites is therefore crucial for better understanding the biological roles of DHA. In this study, we identified and measured, by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, a number of oxygenated products derived from DHA in exsanguinated and nonexsanguinated brains. These metabolites were found both in free form and esterified in phospholipids. Interestingly, both (R)- and (S)-monohydroxylated fatty acid stereoisomers were observed free and esterified in phospholipids. Monohydroxylated metabolites were the main derivatives; however, measurable amounts of dihydroxylated products such as protectin DX were detected. Moreover, exsanguination allowed discriminating brain oxygenated metabolites from those generated in blood. These results obtained in healthy rats allowed an overview on the brain oxygenated metabolism of DHA, which deserves further research in pathophysiological conditions, especially in neurodegenerative diseases.', \"Impact of Lactobacillus fermentum and dairy lipids in the maternal diet on the fatty acid composition of pups' brain and peripheral tissues. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of maternal diets administered since day 1 of gestation and containing dairy lipids or vegetable oils differing in the supply of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) (equilibrated or deficient) and of Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) on the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accretion in the pups at postnatal day 14 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) for brain structures and in the liver and adipose tissue for peripheral tissues. Maternal milk fatty acid composition was also assessed by analyzing the fatty acid composition of the gastric content of the pups. DHA was higher in mice supplemented with L. fermentum than in mice in the deficient group in HC and PFC and also in liver and adipose tissue. This increase could be linked to the slight but significant increase in C18:3n-3 in the maternal milk. This proportion was comparable in the dairy lipid group for which the brain DHA level was the highest. L. fermentum may have a key role in the protection of the brain during the perinatal period via the neuronal accretion of n-3 PUFAs, especially during n-3 PUFA deficiency.\", \"Evidence for the spread of human-derived mutant huntingtin protein in mice and non-human primates. In recent years, substantial evidence has emerged to suggest that spreading of pathological proteins contributes to disease pathology in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. Work from our laboratory and others have shown that, despite its strictly genetic nature, Huntington's disease (HD) may be another condition in which this mechanism contributes to pathology. In this study, we set out to determine if the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) present in post-mortem brain tissue derived from HD patients can induce pathology in mice and/or non-human primates. For this, we performed three distinct sets of experiments where homogenates were injected into the brains of adult a) Wild-type (WT) and b) BACHD mice or c) non-human primates. Neuropathological assessments revealed that, while changes in the endogenous huntingtin were not apparent, mHTT could spread between cellular elements and brain structures. Furthermore, behavioural differences only occurred in the animal model of HD which already overexpressed mHTT. Taken together, our results indicate that mHTT derived from human brains has only a limited capacity to propagate between cells and does not depict prion-like characteristics. This contrasts with recent work demonstrating that other forms of mHTT - such as fibrils of a pathological polyQ length or fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells derived from HD cases - can indeed disseminate disease throughout the brain in a prion-like fashion.\", 'Does the gravity orientation of saccular aneurysms influence hemodynamics? An experimental study with and without flow diverter stent. Most intracranial aneurysms morphologic studies focused on characterization of size, location, aspect ratio, relationship to the surrounding vasculature and hemodynamics. However, the spatial orientation with respect to the gravity direction has not been taken into account although it could trigger various hemodynamic conditions. The present work addresses this possibility. It was divided in two parts: 1) the orientations of 18, 3D time-of-flight MRI (3D TOF MRI), scans of saccular aneurysms were analyzed. This investigation suggested that there was no privileged orientation for cerebral aneurysms. The aneurysms were oriented in the brain as follows: 9 – down, 9 – up; 11 – right, 7 – left; 6 – front, 12 – back. 2) Based on these results, subsidiary in vitro experiments were performed, analyzing the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) within a silicone model of aneurysm before and after flow diverter stent (FDS) deployment in the parent vessel. These experiments used a test bench that reproduces physiological pulsatile flow conditions for two orientations: an aneurysm sack pointing either up (opposite to gravitational force) and down (along the gravitational force). The results showed that the orientation of an aneurysm significantly affects the intra-aneurysmal RBCs behavior after stenting, and therefore that gravity can affect the intra-aneurysm behavior of RBCs. This suggests that the patient׳s aneurysm orientation could impact the outcome of the FDS treatment. The implementation of this effect in patient-specific numerical and preoperative decision support techniques could contribute to better understand the intrasaccular biological and hemodynamic events induced by FDS.', 'Sharing brain mapping statistical results with the neuroimaging data model. Only a tiny fraction of the data and metadata produced by an fMRI study is finally conveyed to the community. This lack of transparency not only hinders the reproducibility of neuroimaging results but also impairs future meta-analyses. In this work we introduce NIDM-Results, a format specification providing a machine-readable description of neuroimaging statistical results along with key image data summarising the experiment. NIDM-Results provides a unified representation of mass univariate analyses including a level of detail consistent with available best practices. This standardized representation allows authors to relay methods and results in a platform-independent regularized format that is not tied to a particular neuroimaging software package. Tools are available to export NIDM-Result graphs and associated files from the widely used SPM and FSL software packages, and the NeuroVault repository can import NIDM-Results archives. The specification is publically available at: http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/nidm-results.html.', 'Diagnostic and predictive value of Doppler ultrasound for evaluation of the brain circulation in preterm infants: a systematic review. Introduction: Very and extremely preterm infants frequently have brain injury-related long-term neurodevelopmental problems. Altered perfusion, for example, seen in the context of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), has been linked to injury of the immature brain. However, a direct relation with outcome has not been reviewed systematically. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of the value of different cerebral arterial blood flow parameters assessed by Doppler ultrasound, in relation to brain injury, to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. Results: In total, 23 studies were included. Because of heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis of results was not possible. All included studies on resistance index (RI) showed significantly higher values in subjects with a hemodynamically significant PDA. However, absolute differences in RI values were small. Studies using Doppler parameters to predict brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome were inconsistent. Discussion: There is no clear evidence to support the routine determination of RI or other Doppler parameters in the cerebral arteries to predict brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in the preterm infant. However, there is evidence that elevated RI can point to the presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA.', 'Ultrasound of acquired posterior fossa abnormalities in the newborn. Neonatal brain sonography is part of routine clinical practice in neonatal intensive care units, but ultrasound imaging of the posterior fossa has gained increasing attention since the burden of perinatal acquired posterior fossa abnormalities and their impact on motor and cognitive neurodevelopmental outcome have been recognized. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often superior, posterior fossa abnormalities can be suspected or detected by optimized cranial ultrasound (CUS)\\xa0scans, which allow an early and bed-side diagnosis and monitoring through sequential scans over a long period of time. Different ultrasound appearances and injury patterns of posterior fossa abnormalities are described according to gestational age at birth and characteristics of the pathogenetic insult. The aim of this review article is to describe options to improve posterior fossa sequential CUS image quality, including the use of supplemental acoustic windows, to show standard views and normal ultrasound anatomy of the posterior fossa, and to describe the ultrasound characteristics of acquired posterior fossa lesions in preterm and term infants with effect on long-term outcome. The limitations and pitfalls of CUS and the role of MRI are discussed.', 'State-of-the-art neonatal cerebral ultrasound: technique and reporting. In the past three decades, cerebral ultrasound (CUS) has become a trusted technique to study the neonatal brain. It is a relatively cheap, non-invasive, bedside neuroimaging method available in nearly every hospital. Traditionally, CUS was used to detect major abnormalities, such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular hemorrhagic infarction, post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, and (cystic) periventricular leukomalacia (cPVL). The use of different acoustic windows, such as the mastoid and posterior fontanel, and ongoing technological developments, allows for recognizing other lesion patterns (e.g., cerebellar hemorrhage, perforator stroke, developmental venous anomaly). The CUS technique is still being improved with the use of higher transducer frequencies (7.5–18 MHz), 3D applications, advances in vascular imaging (e.g. ultrafast plane wave imaging), and improved B-mode image processing. Nevertheless, the helpfulness of CUS still highly depends on observer skills, knowledge, and experience. In this special article, we discuss how to perform a dedicated state-of-the-art neonatal CUS, and we provide suggestions for structured reporting and quality assessment.', 'Preterm white matter injury: ultrasound diagnosis and classification. White matter injury (WMI) is the most frequent form of preterm brain injury. Cranial ultrasound (CUS) remains the preferred modality for initial and sequential neuroimaging in preterm infants, and is reliable for the diagnosis of cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Although magnetic resonance imaging is superior to CUS in detecting the diffuse and more subtle forms of WMI that prevail in very premature infants surviving nowadays, recent improvement in the quality of neonatal CUS imaging has broadened the spectrum of preterm white matter abnormalities that can be detected with this technique. We propose a structured CUS assessment of WMI of prematurity that seeks to account for both cystic and non-cystic changes, as well as signs of white matter loss and impaired brain growth and maturation, at or near term equivalent age. This novel assessment system aims to improve disease description in both routine clinical practice and clinical research. Whether this systematic assessment will improve prediction of outcome in preterm infants with WMI still needs to be evaluated in prospective studies.', 'Cranial ultrasound findings in preterm germinal matrix haemorrhage, sequelae and outcome. Germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH-IVH), periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PHI) and its complication, post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD), are still common neonatal morbidities in preterm infants that are highly associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Typical cranial ultrasound (CUS) findings of GMH-IVH, PHI and PHVD, their anatomical substrates and underlying mechanisms are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, we propose a detailed descriptive classification of GMH-IVH and PHI that may improve quality of CUS reporting and prediction of outcome in infants suffering from GMH-IVH/PHI.', \"Metabolic Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: Bioenergetics, Redox Homeostasis and Central Carbon Metabolism. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the accumulation of protein inclusions (Lewy bodies) are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is triggered by genetic alterations, environmental/occupational exposures and aging. However, the exact molecular mechanisms linking these PD risk factors to neuronal dysfunction are still unclear. Alterations in redox homeostasis and bioenergetics (energy failure) are thought to be central components of neurodegeneration that contribute to the impairment of important homeostatic processes in dopaminergic cells such as protein quality control mechanisms, neurotransmitter release/metabolism, axonal transport of vesicles and cell survival. Importantly, both bioenergetics and redox homeostasis are coupled to neuro-glial central carbon metabolism. We and others have recently established a link between the alterations in central carbon metabolism induced by PD risk factors, redox homeostasis and bioenergetics and their contribution to the survival/death of dopaminergic cells. In this review, we focus on the link between metabolic dysfunction, energy failure and redox imbalance in PD, making an emphasis in the contribution of central carbon (glucose) metabolism. The evidence summarized here strongly supports the consideration of PD as a disorder of cell metabolism.\", 'Neuroscience: Boosting the brain. A therapeutic effect of vagus nerve stimulation has been reported for a wide range of neurological, medical and psychiatric conditions. New research provides evidence that this effect results from extensive increase of physiological arousal and brain activation.', 'Serotonin 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor biased agonists induce different cerebral metabolic responses: a [<sup>18</sup>f]-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography study in conscious and anesthetized rats. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptors constitute an attractive therapeutic target for various psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. These receptors are expressed in multiple brain regions on different neuronal populations and can be coupled with distinct G-protein subtypes; such functional diversity complicates the use of 5-HT1A ligands in several pathologies where it would be desirable to stimulate the receptors in a precise region. Therefore, using \"biased agonists\" able to target specifically certain subpopulations of 5-HT1A receptors would enable achievement of better therapeutic benefit. Several 5-HT1A receptor biased agonists are currently in development, including NLX-101 (aka F15599) and NLX-112 (aka F13640, befiradol), with preclinical data suggesting that they preferentially target different populations of 5-HT1A receptors. However, most previous studies used invasive and regionally limited approaches. In this context, [18F]-fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging constitutes an interesting technique as it enables noninvasive mapping of the regional brain activity changes following a pharmacological challenge in conscious animals. We report here the evaluation of cerebral glucose metabolism following intraperitoneal injection of different doses of NLX-112 or NLX-101 in conscious or isoflurane-anesthetized rats. The biased agonists produced different metabolic \"fingerprints\" with distinct regional preferences, consistent with previous studies. At equal doses, the effect of NLX-101 was less marked than NLX-112 in the piriform cortex, in the striatum (in terms of inhibition), and in the pontine nuclei and the cerebellum (in terms of activation); furthermore, only NLX-112 increased the glucose metabolism in the parietal cortex, whereas only NLX-101 induced a clear activation in the colliculi and the frontal cortex, which may be related to its distinctive procognitive profile. Both agonist effects were almost completely unapparent in anesthetized animals, underlining the importance of studying serotonergic neurotransmission in the conscious state. In this regard, [18F]FDG-PET imaging seems very complementary with other functional imaging techniques such as pharmacological MRI.', 'Brain plasticity and early rehabilitative care for children after neonatal arterial cerebral infarction. Currently, in the literature of the evidence based medicine, little data are available to confirm the benefit and the specific procedures of an early intervention for a neonatal arterial ischemic stroke. However, data about the effect of an early physical rehabilitation program on the cerebral plasticity, and preliminary results of clinical studies in children with cerebral palsy strongly suggest the benefit of an early rehabilitation with a multidisciplinary approach. The type of the rehabilitation and its frequency must be determined because a wide variability in the practices exists. A comprehensive care, of the children and his family is necessary to limit the orthopaedics but also the social consequences of a neonatal stroke.', 'Repetitive motion compensation for real time intraoperative video processing. In this paper, we present a motion compensation algorithm dedicated to video processing during neurosurgery. After craniotomy, the brain surface undergoes a repetitive motion due to the cardiac pulsation. This motion as well as potential video camera motion prevent accurate video analysis. We propose a dedicated motion model where the brain deformation is described using a linear basis learned from a few initial frames of the video. As opposed to other works using linear basis for the flow, the camera motion is explicitly accounted in the transformation model. Despite the nonlinear nature of our model, all the motion parameters are robustly estimated all at once, using only one singular value decomposition (SVD), making our procedure computationally efficient. A Lagrangian specification of the flow field ensures the stability of the method. Experiments on in vivo data are presented to evaluate the capacity of the method to cope with occlusion or camera motion. The method we propose satisfies the intraoperative constraints: it is robust to surgical tools occlusions, it works in real time, and it is able to handle large camera viewpoint changes.', \"Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume identified through genome-wide association. Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (genetic = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis (N combined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits.\", 'A simplified framework to optimize MRI contrast preparation. Purpose : This article proposes a rigorous optimal control framework for the design of preparation schemes that optimize MRI contrast based on relaxation time differences. Methods : Compared to previous optimal contrast preparation schemes, a drastic reduction of the optimization parameter number is performed. The preparation scheme is defined as a combination of several block pulses whose flip angles, phase terms and inter-pulse delays are optimized to control the magnetization evolution. Results : The proposed approach reduces the computation time of B0-robust preparation schemes to around a minute (whereas several hours were required with previous schemes), with negligible performance loss. The chosen parameterization allows to formulate the total preparation duration as a constraint, which improves the overall compromise between contrast performance and preparation time. Simulation, in vitro and in vivo results validate this improvement, illustrate the straightforward applicability of the proposed approach, and point out its flexibility in terms of achievable contrasts. Major improvement is especially achieved for short-T2 enhancement, as shown by the acquisition of a non-trivial contrast on a rat brain, where a short-T2 white matter structure (corpus callosum) is enhanced compared to surrounding gray matter tissues (hippocampus and neocortex). Conclusions : This approach proposes key advances for the design of optimal contrast preparation sequences, that emphasize their ability to generate non-standard contrasts, their potential benefit in a clinical context, and their straightforward applicability on any MR system.', 'Hard to wake up? The cerebral correlates of sleep inertia assessed using combined behavioral, EEG and fMRI measures. The first minutes following awakening from sleep are typically marked by reduced vigilance, increased sleepiness and impaired performance, a state referred to as sleep inertia. Although the behavioral aspects of sleep inertia are well documented, its cerebral correlates remain poorly understood. The present study aimed at filling this gap by measuring in 34 participants the changes in behavioral performance (descending subtraction task, DST), EEG spectral power, and resting-state fMRI functional connectivity across three time points: before an early-afternoon 45-min nap, 5 min after awakening from the nap and 25 min after awakening. Our results showed impaired performance at the DST at awakening and an intrusion of sleep-specific features (spectral power and functional connectivity) into wakefulness brain activity, the intensity of which was dependent on the prior sleep duration and depth for the functional connectivity (14 participants awakened from N2 sleep, 20 from N3 sleep). Awakening in N3 (deep) sleep induced the most robust changes and was characterized by a global loss of brain functional segregation between task-positive (dorsal attention, salience, sensorimotor) and task-negative (default mode) networks. Significant correlations were observed notably between the EEG delta power and the functional connectivity between the default and dorsal attention networks, as well as between the percentage of mistake at the DST and the default network functional connectivity. These results highlight (1) significant correlations between EEG and fMRI functional connectivity measures, (2) significant correlations between the behavioral aspect of sleep inertia and measures of the cerebral functioning at awakening (both EEG and fMRI), and (3) the important difference in the cerebral underpinnings of sleep inertia at awakening from N2 and N3 sleep.', 'Role of brain imaging for Parkinsonism.

They preserve brain three-dimensional architecture, synaptic connectivity and brain cells microenvironment. Here, we developed an innovative model of Huntington’s disease from coronal rat brain slices, that include all the areas involved in the pathology. HD-like neurodegeneration was obtained in only one week, in a single step, during organotypic slice preparation, without the use of neurotoxins. HD-like histopathology was analysed and after one week, a reduction of 40% of medium spiny neurons was observed. To analyse new therapeutic approaches in this innovative HD model, we developed a novel protocol of laser microdissection to isolate and analyse by RT-qPCR, grafted cells as well as surrounding tissue of fresh organotypic slices. We determined that laser microdissection could be performed on a 400μm organotypic slice after alcohol dehydration protocol, allowing the analysis of mRNA expression in the rat tissue as well as in grafted cells. In conclusion, we developed a new approach for modeling Huntington’s disease ex vivo, and provided a useful innovative method for screening new potential therapies for neurodegenerative diseases especially when associated with laser microdissection.', 'Relationship Between Brain Amyloid Deposition and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living in Older Adults: A Longitudinal Study from the Multidomain Alzheimer Prevention Trial. Objectives: To examine the evolution of instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) performance according to the presence of brain amyloid deposition. Design: Longitudinal analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Setting: Neuroimaging ancillary study from the Multidomain Alzheimer Prevention Trial (MAPT). Participants: Community-dwelling individuals aged 70 and older without dementia (N = 269; 60% female, mean age 75±4). Measurements: Linear mixed models were used to assess the 36-month evolution of the performance of an IADL questionnaire for primary prevention studies in dementia, the Activity of Daily Living Prevention Instrument (ADL-PI), according to the presence of amyloid deposition using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) (standardized uptake value≥1.17). Additional analyses were also conducted to examine the changes in specific domains of daily functioning with and without adjustment for age, sex, apolipoprotein E, randomization group, and time between baseline and PET examination. Results: One hundred two (37.9%) participants were amyloid positive. Amyloid-negative participants had statistically significant improvement in ADL-PI total score between baseline and 36 months (p=.04). The difference after 3 years between amyloid-positive and -negative participants was not significant (β=–0.95±0.53 at 36 months, p=.08; adjusted models: β=–1.07±0.56, p=.06). Amyloid-negative participants also improved in memory-related IADLs (p<.001) throughout the study, unlike amyloid-positive participants. Conclusion: Amyloid-positive and -negative older adults are likely to have different trajectories in IADL performance. Future research is needed to better understand the relationship between amyloid plaques and functional limitations.', 'Type I interferon receptor signaling drives selective permissiveness of astrocytes and microglia to measles virus during brain infection. Fatal neurological syndromes can occur after measles virus (MeV) infection of the brain. The mechanisms controlling MeV spread within the central nervous system (CNS) remain poorly understood. We analyzed the role of type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) signaling in the control of MeV infection in a murine model of brain infection. Using organotypic brain cultures (OBC) from wild-type and IFNAR-knockout (IFNARKO) transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the human SLAM (CD150) receptor, the heterogeneity of the permissiveness of different CNS cell types to MeV infection was characterized. In the absence of IFNAR signaling, MeV propagated significantly better in explant slices. In OBC from IFNAR-competent mice, while astrocytes and microglia were infected on the day of explant preparation, they became refractory to infection with time, in contrast to neurons and oligodendrocytes, which remained permissive to infection. This selective loss of permissiveness to MeV infection was not observed in IFNARKO mouse OBC. Accordingly, the development of astrogliosis related to the OBC procedure was exacerbated in the presence of IFNAR signaling. In the hippocampus, this astrogliosis was characterized by a change in the astrocyte phenotype and by an increase of IFN-I transcripts. A proteome analysis showed the upregulation of 84 out of 111 secreted proteins. In the absence of IFNAR, only 27 secreted proteins were upregulated, and none of these were associated with antiviral activities. Our results highlight the essential role of the IFN-I response in astrogliosis and in the permissiveness of astrocytes and microglia that could control MeV propagation throughout the CNS.', 'Use of Vitamin K Antagonists and Brain Morphological Changes in Older Adults: An Exposed/Unexposed Voxel-Based Morphometric Study. Background: Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for their role in haemostasis by interfering with the vitamin K cycle. Since vitamin K also participates in brain physiology, this voxel-based morphometric study aimed to determine whether the duration of exposure to VKAs correlated with focal brain volume reduction in older adults. Methods: In this exposed/unexposed (1: 2) study nested within the GAIT (Gait and Alzheimer Interactions Tracking) cohort, 18 participants exposed to VKA (mean age 75 ± 5 years; 33.3% female; mean exposure 2,122 ± 1,799 days) and 36 matched participants using no VKA (mean age 75 ± 5 years; 33.3% female) underwent MRI scanning of the brain. Cortical grey and white matter volumes were automatically segmented using statistical parametric mapping. Age, gender, educational level, history of atrial fibrillation, type of MRI, and total intracranial volume were included as covariables. Results: The duration of exposure to VKA correlated inversely across the whole brain with the subvolumes of two clusters in the grey matter (right frontal inferior operculum and right precuneus) and one cluster in the white matter (left middle frontal gyrus). In contrast, the grade of white matter hyperintensities did not differ according to the use of VKA. Conclusion: We found focal atrophies in older adults exposed to VKA. These findings provide new insights elucidating the effects of VKAs on brain health and function in older adults.', \"Gut nutrient sensing and microbiota function in the control of energy homeostasis. Purpose of review To analyze the respective roles of macronutrient-derived moieties, of a gut mucosal function [intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN)] and its capacity of influencing the brain control of energy homeostasis, and of the microbiota 'function' versus 'genomic composition' in the control of host metabolism. Recent findings Small products deriving from protein digestion (peptides) or from fermentation by the gut microbiota (short-chain fatty acids and succinate) activate IGN, a mucosal function sensed by the peripheral gut nervous system, which intitiates metabolic benefits deriving from brain control of energy homeostasis. The microbiota function (fermentation) rather than its genomic composition is a key in these processes. Summary Short-chain fatty acids and succinate produced from the fermentation of macronutrients by the gut microbiota positively influence the brain's control of energy homeostasis via the activation of IGN. The microbiota function rather than genomic composition is a key in these processes.\", 'A review of rapid serial visual presentation-based brain-computer interfaces. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) combined with the detection of event-related brain responses facilitates the selection of relevant information contained in a stream of images presented rapidly to a human. Event related potentials (ERPs) measured non-invasively with electroencephalography (EEG) can be associated with infrequent targets amongst a stream of images. Human-machine symbiosis may be augmented by enabling human interaction with a computer, without overt movement, and/or enable optimization of image/information sorting processes involving humans. Features of the human visual system impact on the success of the RSVP paradigm, but pre-attentive processing supports the identification of target information post presentation of the information by assessing the co-occurrence or time-locked EEG potentials. This paper presents a comprehensive review and evaluation of the limited, but significant, literature on research in RSVP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Applications that use RSVP-based BCIs are categorized based on display mode and protocol design, whilst a range of factors influencing ERP evocation and detection are analyzed. Guidelines for using the RSVP-based BCI paradigms are recommended, with a view to further standardizing methods and enhancing the inter-relatability of experimental design to support future research and the use of RSVP-based BCIs in practice.', 'Synaptic regulator α-synuclein in dopaminergic fibers is essentially required for the maintenance of subependymal neural stem cells. Synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-SYN) modulates neurotransmission in a complex and poorly understood manner and aggregates in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons in Parkinsonʹs disease. Here, we report that α-SYN present in dopaminergic nigral afferents is essential for the normal cycling and maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the brain subependymal zone of adult male and female mice. We also show that premature senescence of adult NSCs into non-neurogenic astrocytes in mice lacking α-SYN resembles the effects of dopaminergic fiber degeneration resulting from chronic exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine or intranigral inoculation of aggregated toxic α-SYN. Interestingly, NSC loss in α-SYN-deficient mice can be prevented by viral delivery of human α-SYN into their sustantia nigra or by treatment with L -DOPA, suggesting that α-SYN regulates dopamine availability to NSCs. Our data indicate that α-SYN, present in dopaminergic nerve terminals supplying the subependymal zone, acts as a niche component to sustain the neurogenic potential of adult NSCs and identify α-SYN and DA as potential targets to ameliorate neurogenic defects in the aging and diseased brain.', \"Exchangeable copper: a reflection of the neurological severity in Wilson's disease. Background and purpose: The severity of Wilson's disease (WD) is linked to free copper accumulating in the liver and brain. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) is a new technique to determine plasmatic copper and is useful in the diagnosis of WD. It is hypothesized that it may also enable a good evaluation of extra-hepatic involvement and its severity. Methods: Forty-eight newly diagnosed WD patients were prospectively evaluated using hepatic, neurological, ophthalmological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores. Three phenotypic presentations were distinguished: pre-symptomatic, hepatic and extra-hepatic. CuEXC was determined in addition to standard copper assays before decoppering therapy. Correlations between biological parameters and the different scores were determined and compared in the hepatic and extra-hepatic groups. Results: Extra-hepatic patients had significantly higher CuEXC values than those with the hepatic form (P < 0.0001). The overall ability of CuEXC to separate the two forms was satisfactory, with an area under the curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.771–0.996) and an optimal threshold for extra-hepatic diagnosis of 2.08 μmol/l (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 94.1%). In extra-hepatic patients, CuEXC was the only biological marker to be positively correlated with the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Score (r = 0.45, P = 0.016), the Kayser−Fleischer ring score (r = 0.46, P = 0.014) and the brain MRI score (r = 0.38, P = 0.048), but it was not correlated with the hepatic score. Conclusions: Exchangeable copper determination is useful when diagnosing WD as a value >2.08 μmol/l is indicative of the severity of the extra-hepatic involvement. In the case of purely hepatic presentation, atypical or mild neurological signs, it should encourage physicians to search for lesions in the brain and eyes.\", 'Neuroimaging findings in Mowat-Wilson syndrome: A study of 54 patients. Purpose:Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a genetic disease characterized by distinctive facial features, moderate to severe intellectual disability, and congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung disease, genital and eye anomalies, and congenital heart defects, caused by haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 gene. To date, no characteristic pattern of brain dysmorphology in MWS has been defined.Methods:Through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, we delineated a neuroimaging phenotype in 54 MWS patients with a proven ZEB2 defect, compared it with the features identified in a thorough review of published cases, and evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations.Results:Ninety-six percent of patients had abnormal MRI results. The most common features were anomalies of corpus callosum (79.6% of cases), hippocampal abnormalities (77.8%), enlargement of cerebral ventricles (68.5%), and white matter abnormalities (reduction of thickness 40.7%, localized signal alterations 22.2%). Other consistent findings were large basal ganglia, cortical, and cerebellar malformations. Most features were underrepresented in the literature. We also found ZEB2 variations leading to synthesis of a defective protein to be favorable for psychomotor development and some epilepsy features but also associated with corpus callosum agenesis.Conclusion:This study delineated the spectrum of brain anomalies in MWS and provided new insights into the role of ZEB2 in neurodevelopment.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging changes following natalizumab discontinuation in multiple sclerosis patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Background: Detecting early progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) is clinically relevant. Objective: Evaluating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes following natalizumab (NTZ) discontinuation and preceding PML-IRIS. Methods: MRIs (including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR), post-contrast T1-weighted sequences) were performed every week following PML diagnosis in 11 consecutive NTZ-PML patients. PML expansion, punctate lesions, contrast-enhancement, and mass-effect/edema were evaluated on each MRI sequence, following NTZ discontinuation. Results: PML-IRIS occurred from 26 to 89 days after NTZ discontinuation. MRI changes prior to early PML-IRIS appeared significantly more pronounced using DWI compared to T2-FLAIR imaging (p < 0.003). Two DWI features (marked PML expansion, punctate lesions) systematically preceded contrast-enhancement. Conclusion: Subtle changes may occur on DWI preceding contrast-enhancement.', 'Mechanism of action of s1p receptor modulators in multiple sclerosis: The double requirement. The ideal treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) would target both the neuroinflammatory component of the disease (peripheral and central) and its neurodegenerative component, via modulation of a ubiquitous and pleiotropic common target. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingosine metabolism, regulates many biological functions (including cell proliferation and survival, cell migration, the immune response and cardiovascular function) via five subtypes of receptor. These receptors are expressed in all types of brain cells where they modulate a number of processes involved in neuronal plasticity, including myelination, neurogenesis and neuroprotection. This profile has aroused interest in modulation of S1P function as a therapeutic target in many brain diseases, particularly those in which the immune system plays a role in the development of brain lesions. Fingolimod, a S1P receptor modulator, exerts its beneficial effects in MS through its anti-inflammatory and anti-neurodegenerative effects. This review discusses recent evidence indicating that fingolimod may target both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process in MS.', 'Learning from Mouse CT-Scan Brain Images to Detect MRA-TOF Human Vasculatures. The earlier studies on brain vasculature semantic segmentation used classical image analysis methods to extract the vascular tree from images. Nowadays, deep learning methods are widely exploited for various image analysis tasks. One of the strong restrictions when dealing with neural networks in the framework of semantic segmentation is the need to dispose of a ground truth segmentation dataset, on which the task will be learned. It may be cumbersome to manually segment the arteries in a 3D volumes (MRA-TOF typically). In this work, we aim to tackle the vascular tree segmentation from a new perspective. Our objective is to build an image dataset from mouse vasculatures acquired using CT-Scans, and enhance these vasculatures in such a way to precisely mimic the statistical properties of the human brain. The segmentation of mouse images is easily automatized thanks to their specific acquisition modality. Thus, such a framework allows to generate the data necessary for the training of a Convolutional Neural Network - i.e. the enhanced mouse images and there corresponding ground truth segmentation - without requiring any manual segmentation procedure. However, in order to generate an image dataset having consistent properties (strong resemblance with MRA images), we have to ensure that the statistical properties of the enhanced mouse images do match correctly the human MRA acquisitions. In this work, we evaluate at length the similarities between the human arteries as acquired on MRA-TOF and the humanized mouse arteries produced by our model. Finally, once the model duly validated, we experiment its applicability with a Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Proton MRS on sub-microliter volume in rat brain using implantable NMR microcoils. The use of miniaturized NMR receiver coils is an effective approach for improving detection sensitivity in studies using MRS and MRI. By optimizing the filling factor (the fraction of the coil occupied by the sample), and by increasing the RF magnetic field produced per unit current, the sensitivity gain offered by NMR microcoils is particularly interesting when small volumes or regions of interest are investigated. For in vivo studies, millimetric or sub-millimetric microcoils can be deployed in tissues to access regions of interest located at a certain depth. In this study, the implementation and application of a tissue-implantable NMR microcoil with a detection volume of 850 nL is described. The RF magnetic field generated by the microcoil was evaluated using a finite element method simulation and experimentally determined by high spatial resolution MRI acquisitions. The performance of the microcoil in terms of spectral resolution and limit of detection was measured at 7 T in vitro and in vivo in rodent brains. These performances were compared with those of a conventional external detection coil. Proton MR spectra were acquired in the cortex of rat brain. The concentrations of main metabolites were quantified and compared with reference values from the literature. In vitro and in vivo results obtained with the implantable microcoil showed a gain in sensitivity greater than 50 compared with detection using an external coil. In vivo proton spectra of diagnostic value were obtained from brain regions of a few hundred nanoliters. The similarities between spectra obtained with the implanted microcoil and those obtained with the external NMR coil highlight the minimally invasive nature of the coil implantation procedure. These implantable microcoils represent new tools for probing tissue metabolism in very small healthy or diseased regions using MRS.', 'The hedgehog pathway suppresses neuropathogenesis in CD4 T cell-driven inflammation. The concerted actions of the CNS and the immune system are essential to coordinating the outcome of neuroinflammatory responses. Yet, the precise mechanisms involved in this crosstalk and their contribution to the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory diseases largely elude us. Here, we show that the CNS-endogenous hedgehog pathway, a signal triggered as part of the host response during the inflammatory phase of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, attenuates the pathogenicity of human and mouse effector CD4 T cells by regulating their production of inflammatory cytokines. Using a murine genetic model, in which the hedgehog signalling is compromised in CD4 T cells, we show that the hedgehog pathway acts on CD4 T cells to suppress the pathogenic hallmarks of autoimmune neuroinflammation, including demyelination and axonal damage, and thus mitigates the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Impairment of hedgehog signalling in CD4 T cells exacerbates brain-brainstem-cerebellum inflammation and leads to the development of atypical disease. Moreover, we present evidence that hedgehog signalling regulates the pathogenic profile of CD4 T cells by limiting their production of the inflammatory cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-γ and by antagonizing their inflammatory program at the transcriptome level. Likewise, hedgehog signalling attenuates the inflammatory phenotype of human CD4 memory T cells. From a therapeutic point of view, our study underlines the potential of harnessing the hedgehog pathway to counteract ongoing excessive CNS inflammation, as systemic administration of a hedgehog agonist after disease onset effectively halts disease progression and significantly reduces neuroinflammation and the underlying neuropathology. We thus unveil a previously unrecognized role for the hedgehog pathway in regulating pathogenic inflammation within the CNS and propose to exploit its ability to modulate this neuroimmune network as a strategy to limit the progression of ongoing neuroinflammation.', 'Standard diffusion-weighted imaging in the brain can detect cervical internal carotid artery dissections. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ICA is the most common site of cervical artery dissection. Prompt and reliable identification of the mural hematoma is warranted when a dissection is clinically suspected. The purpose of this study was to assess to capacity of a standard DWI sequence acquired routinely on the brain to detect dissecting hematoma related to cervical ICA dissections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of a cohort of 110 patients younger than 55 years of age (40 women; mean age, 46.79 years) admitted at the acute phase of a neurologic deficit, headache, or neck pain and investigated by at least a standard 3T diffusion-weighted sequence of the brain. Among them were 50 patients (14 women; mean age, 46.72 years) with subsequently confirmed ICA dissection. In the whole anonymized cohort, both a senior and junior radiologist separately assessed, on the DWI sequences only, the presence of a crescent-shaped or circular hypersignal projecting on the subpetrosal segment of the ICA arteries, assuming that it would correspond to a mural hematoma related to an ICA dissection. RESULTS: The senior radiologist found 46 subpetrosal hyperintensities in 43/50 patients with ICA dissection and none in patients without dissection (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 100%). The junior radiologist found 48 subpetrosal hyperintensities in 45/50 patients with dissection and none in patients without dissection (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 100%). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, a standard DWI sequence performed on the brain at the acute phase of a stroke or for a clinical suspicion of dissection detected nearly 90% of cervical ICA dissections.', 'Pregnane X Receptor Deletion Modifies Recognition Memory and Electroencephalographic Activity. Nuclear receptors (NR) are emerging as key players in the central nervous system (CNS) with reported implications in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. While a number of NR has been studied, it is unknown whether invalidation of the pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR, NR1I2) corresponds to neurological modifications in the adult brain. PXR−/− C57BL/6 J and wild-type mice were used to investigate: (i) recognition memory, motor coordination, and anxiety-like behaviors; (ii) longitudinal video-electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and frequency wave analysis; (iii) neurovascular structures by histological evaluation and expression of the cerebrovascular tight junctions ZO1 and CLDN5. Absence of PXR was associated with anxiety-like behavior and recognition memory impairment in adult mice. The latter was simultaneous to an EEG signature of lower theta frequency during sleep and abnormal delta waves. Neurophysiological changes did not correspond to significant structural changes in the adult brain, expect for a localized and minor increase in the fronto-parietal neurovascular density and reduced ZO1, but not CLDN5, expression in isolated brain capillaries. Our results converge with existing evidence supporting a link between NR expression and brain physiology. Although the exact modalities remain to be elucidated, the possibility that extra-physiological modulation of PXR may constitute a pathophysiological entry point or a molecular target for brain diseases is proposed.', 'Specialized neural dynamics for verbal and tonal memory: fMRI evidence in congenital amusia. Behavioral and neuropsychological studies have suggested that tonal and verbal short-term memory are supported by specialized neural networks. To date however, neuroimaging investigations have failed to confirm this hypothesis. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis of distinct neural resources for tonal and verbal memory by comparing typical nonmusician listeners to individuals with congenital amusia, who exhibit pitch memory impairments with preserved verbal memory. During fMRI, amusics and matched controls performed delayed-match-to-sample tasks with tones and words and perceptual control tasks with the same stimuli. For tonal maintenance, amusics showed decreased activity in the right auditory cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorso-lateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Moreover, they exhibited reduced right-lateralized functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and the IFG during tonal encoding and between the IFG and the DLPFC during tonal maintenance. In contrasts, amusics showed no difference compared with the controls for verbal memory, with activation in the left IFG and left fronto-temporal connectivity. Critically, we observed a group-by-material interaction in right fronto-temporal regions: while amusics recruited these regions less strongly for tonal memory than verbal memory, control participants showed the reversed pattern (tonal > verbal). By benefitting from the rare condition of amusia, our findings suggest specialized cortical systems for tonal and verbal short-term memory in the human brain.', 'Preserved structural connectivity mediates the clinical effect of thrombolysis in patients with anterior-circulation stroke. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke aims to restore compromised blood flow and prevent further neuronal damage. Despite the proven clinical efficacy of this treatment, little is known about the short-term effects of systemic thrombolysis on structural brain connectivity. In this secondary analysis of the WAKE-UP trial, we used MRI-derived measures of infarct size and estimated structural network disruption to establish that thrombolysis is associated not only with less infarct growth, but also with reduced loss of large-scale connectivity between grey-matter areas after stroke. In a causal mediation analysis, infarct growth mediated a non-significant 8.3% (CI95% [−8.0, 32.6]%) of the clinical effect of thrombolysis on functional outcome. The proportion mediated jointly through infarct growth and change of structural connectivity, especially in the border zone around the infarct core, however, was as high as 33.4% (CI95% [8.8, 77.4]%). Preservation of structural connectivity is thus an important determinant of treatment success and favourable functional outcome in addition to lesion volume. It might, in the future, serve as an imaging endpoint in clinical trials or as a target for therapeutic interventions.', 'Nutrition for the ageing brain: Towards evidence for an optimal diet. As people age they become increasingly susceptible to chronic and extremely debilitating brain diseases. The precise cause of the neuronal degeneration underlying these disorders, and indeed normal brain ageing remains however elusive. Considering the limits of existing preventive methods, there is a desire to develop effective and safe strategies. Growing preclinical and clinical research in healthy individuals or at the early stage of cognitive decline has demonstrated the beneficial impact of nutrition on cognitive functions. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe). The latest scientific advances specific to how dietary nutrients and non-nutrient may affect cognitive ageing are presented. Furthermore, several key points related to mechanisms contributing to brain ageing, pathological conditions affecting brain function, and brain biomarkers are also discussed. Overall, findings are inconsistent and fragmented and more research is warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms and to establish dose-response relationships for optimal brain maintenance in different population subgroups. Such approaches are likely to provide the necessary evidence to develop research portfolios that will inform about new dietary recommendations on how to prevent cognitive decline.', 'Role of astrocytes, microglia, and tanycytes in brain control of systemic metabolism. Astrocytes, microglia, and tanycytes play active roles in the regulation of hypothalamic feeding circuits. These non-neuronal cells are crucial in determining the functional interactions of specific neuronal subpopulations involved in the control of metabolism. Recent advances in biology, optics, genetics, and pharmacology have resulted in the emergence of novel and highly sophisticated approaches for studying hypothalamic neuronal–glial networks. Here we summarize the progress in the field and argue that glial–neuronal interactions provide a core hub integrating food-related cues, interoceptive signals, and internal states to adapt a complex set of physiological responses operating on different timescales to finely tune behavior and metabolism according to metabolic status. This expanding knowledge helps to redefine our understanding of the physiology of food intake and energy metabolism.', 'Brain Health Services: organization, structure, and challenges for implementation. A user manual for Brain Health Services—part 1 of 6. Dementia has a devastating impact on the quality of life of patients and families and comes with a huge cost to society. Dementia prevention is considered a public health priority by the World Health Organization. Delaying the onset of dementia by treating associated risk factors will bring huge individual and societal benefit. Empirical evidence suggests that, in higher-income countries, dementia incidence is decreasing as a result of healthier lifestyles. This observation supports the notion that preventing dementia is possible and that a certain degree of prevention is already in action. Further reduction of dementia incidence through deliberate prevention plans is needed to counteract its growing prevalence due to increasing life expectancy. An increasing number of individuals with normal cognitive performance seek help in the current memory clinics asking an evaluation of their dementia risk, preventive interventions, or interventions to ameliorate their cognitive performance. Consistent evidence suggests that some of these individuals are indeed at increased risk of dementia. This new health demand asks for a shift of target population, from patients with cognitive impairment to worried but cognitively unimpaired individuals. However, current memory clinics do not have the programs and protocols in place to deal with this new population. We envision the development of new services, henceforth called Brain Health Services, devoted to respond to demands from cognitively unimpaired individuals concerned about their risk of dementia. The missions of Brain Health Services will be (i) dementia risk profiling, (ii) dementia risk communication, (iii) dementia risk reduction, and (iv) cognitive enhancement. In this paper, we present the organizational and structural challenges associated with the set-up of Brain Health Services.', 'Neural effects of mindfulness-based interventions on patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review. Growing evidence has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could have beneficial effects on the acute phase of depression and on the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence. Despite growing clinical interest, the effects of MBIs on brain functioning in patients with MDD remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the changes in brain functioning associated with MBIs in patients with MDD. A systematic search was conducted, and of the 56 articles found, 8 were eligible. MBIs have modulatory effects on several brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, such as the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, and the parietal cortex. These regions have been implicated in self-awareness, attention and emotion regulation. Some of these findings were consistent with the effects of MBIs observed in healthy subjects and patients with other psychiatric disorders, especially enhanced activity in the frontal and subcortical regions related to the improved somatosensory awareness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of MBIs in MDD.', \"The gut and Parkinson's disease: Hype or hope?. In the last two decades it has become clear that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a plethora of gastrointestinal symptoms originating from functional and structural changes in the gut and its associated neural structures. This is of particular interest not only because such symptoms have a major impact on the quality of life of PD patients, but also since accumulating evidence suggests that in at least a subgroup of patients, these disturbances precede the motor symptoms and diagnosis of PD by years and may thus give important insights into the origin and pathogenesis of the disease. In this mini-review we attempt to concisely summarize the current knowledge after two decades of research on the gut-brain axis in PD. We focus on alpha-synuclein pathology, biomarkers, and the gut microbiota and envision the development and impact of these research areas for the two decades to come.\", 'Carbazole-Substituted Iridium Complex as a Solid State Emitter for Two-Photon Intravital Imaging. A tris-cyclometalated iridium complex that bears two ligands functionalized by peripheral carbazole groups combines an intense solid state emission and a significant two-photon absorption cross section in the near-infrared. After incorporation into a physiological micellar suspension, it can be used for the intravital two-photon fluorescence microscopy of cerebral vasculature.', 'Adaptive quantization of local field potentials for wireless implants in freely moving animals: An open-source neural recording device. Objective. Modern neuroscience research requires electrophysiological recording of local field potentials (LFPs) in moving animals. Wireless transmission has the advantage of removing the wires between the animal and the recording equipment but is hampered by the large number of data to be sent at a relatively high rate. Approach. To reduce transmission bandwidth, we propose an encoder/decoder scheme based on adaptive non-uniform quantization. Our algorithm uses the current transmitted codeword to adapt the quantization intervals to changing statistics in LFP signals. It is thus backward adaptive and does not require the sending of side information. The computational complexity is low and similar at the encoder and decoder sides. These features allow for real-time signal recovery and facilitate hardware implementation with low-cost commercial microcontrollers. Main results. As proof-of-concept, we developed an open-source neural recording device called NeRD. The NeRD prototype digitally transmits eight channels encoded at 10 kHz with 2 bits per sample. It occupies a volume of 2 × 2 × 2 cm3 and weighs 8 g with a small battery allowing for 2 h 40 min of autonomy. The power dissipation is 59.4 mW for a communication range of 8 m and transmission losses below 0.1%. The small weight and low power consumption offer the possibility of mounting the entire device on the head of a rodent without resorting to a separate head-stage and battery backpack. The NeRD prototype is validated in recording LFPs in freely moving rats at 2 bits per sample while maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (>30 dB) over a range of noisy channels. Significance. Adaptive quantization in neural implants allows for lower transmission bandwidths while retaining high signal fidelity and preserving fundamental frequencies in LFPs.', 'Fish oil supplementation alleviates metabolic and anxiodepressive effects of diet-induced obesity and associated changes in brain lipid composition in mice. Objective: Obesity significantly elevates the odds of developing mood disorders. Chronic consumption of a saturated high-fat diet (HFD) elicits anxiodepressive behavior in a manner linked to metabolic dysfunction and neuroinflammation in mice. Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) can improve both metabolic and mood impairments by relieving inflammation. Despite these findings, the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on energy homeostasis, anxiodepressive behavior, brain lipid composition, and gliosis in the diet-induced obese state are unclear. Methods: Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed a saturated high-fat diet (HFD) or chow for 20 weeks. During the last 5 weeks mice received daily gavage (“supplementation”) of fish oil (FO) enriched with equal amounts of docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or control corn oil. Food intake and body weight were measured throughout while additional metabolic parameters and anxiety- and despair-like behavior (elevated-plus maze, light–dark box, and forced swim tasks) were evaluated during the final week of supplementation. Forebrain lipid composition and markers of microglia activation and astrogliosis were assessed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and real-time PCR, respectively. Results: Five weeks of FO supplementation corrected glucose intolerance and attenuated hyperphagia in HFD-induced obese mice without affecting adipose mass. FO supplementation also defended against the anxiogenic and depressive-like effects of HFD. Brain lipids, particularly anti-inflammatory PUFA, were diminished by HFD, whereas FO restored levels beyond control values. Gene expression markers of brain reactive gliosis were supressed by FO. Conclusions: Supplementing a saturated HFD with FO rich in EPA and DHA corrects glucose intolerance, inhibits food intake, suppresses anxiodepressive behaviors, enhances anti-inflammatory brain lipids, and dampens indices of brain gliosis in obese mice. Together, these findings support increasing dietary n-3 PUFA for the treatment of metabolic and mood disturbances associated with excess fat intake and obesity.', 'Subcortical SISCOM hyperperfusion: Should we pay more attention to it?. Purpose: Demonstrating cerebral blood flow changes during seizures, ictal-interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with co-registration to MRI (SISCOM) reflects brain activation and its pathways of spread. To investigate subcortical ictal hyperperfusion patterns during focal seizures, we retrospectively reviewed SISCOM analysis of patients who became seizure-free after cortical resection. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between epileptogenic zones and subcortical hyperperfusion. Method: 67 patients were identified as having SISCOM evaluation and having remained seizure-free for at least one year after surgical resection. SISCOM analysis was blindly reviewed for localization of basal ganglia (BG), thalamic (TN) and cerebellar (CH) hyperperfusion based on three different thresholds. Subcortical activation and epilepsy characteristics were then compared between patients. For a given region of interest and threshold, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value for correct lateralization of the epilepsy side was calculated. Results: Depending on the threshold used, BG hyperperfusion was found in 37.3–73.9% of patients, TN hyperperfusion in 31.3–68.1% and CH hyperperfusion in 13.5–29%. For a threshold of 1.5, the best predictive positive value for correct lateralization of the epilepsy side was obtained with BG/CH coactivation (89%). For a threshold of 2.0 and 2.5, it was obtained with BG/TN coactivation (88%) and BG activation (82%), respectively. Conclusion: Subcortical SISCOM hyperperfusion could offer additional clues in terms of lateralization.', 'Changes in brain monoamines underlie behavioural disruptions after zebrafish diet exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons environmental mixtures. Zebrafish were exposed through diet to two environmentally relevant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mixtures of contrasted compositions, one of pyrolytic (PY) origin and one from light crude oil (LO). Monoamine concentrations were quantified in the brains of the fish after six month of exposure. A significant decrease in noradrenaline (NA) was observed in fish exposed to both mixtures, while a decrease in serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) was observed only in LO-exposed fish. A decrease in metabolites of 5HT and DA was observed in fish exposed to both mixtures. Several behavioural disruptions were observed that depended on mixtures, and parallels were made with changes in monoamine concentrations. Indeed, we observed an increase in anxiety in fish exposed to both mixtures, which could be related to the decrease in 5HT and/or NA, while disruptions of daily activity rhythms were observed in LO fish, which could be related to the decrease in DA. Taken together, these results showed that (i) chronic exposures to PAHs mixtures disrupted brain monoamine contents, which could underlie behavioural disruptions, and that (ii) the biological responses depended on mixture compositions.', 'Mapping the hypocretin/orexin neuronal system: An unexpectedly productive journey. Early in 1998, we (de Lecea et al., 1998) and others (Sakurai et al., 1998) described the same hypothalamic neuropeptides, respectively called the hypocretins or orexins, which were discovered using two different approaches. In December of that year, we published the subject of this commentary in the Journal of Neuroscience: a highly detailed anatomical description of the extensive axonal projections of the hypocretin/orexin neurons. Although the function of this system was unknown at the time, a large body of literature today attests that the hypocretin/orexin neuropeptides play important roles in multiple physiological functions, particularly in sleep/wake regulation. Neuroanatomical studies are rarely frontline news, but the citation rate of this paper underscores the critical nature of such basic research. Based in part on this detailed description, the hypocretin/orexin neuropeptides have since been studied in many different areas of neuroscience research, including sleep/wake regulation, feeding, addiction, reward and motivation, anxiety and depression, cardiovascular regulation, pain, migraine, and neuroendocrine regulation, including reproduction. Thus, this paper has had a surprisingly broad impact on neuroscience research, particularly since it was originally rejected by the Journal!.', 'Architecture of the Mouse Brain Synaptome. Synapses are found in vast numbers in the brain and contain complex proteomes. We developed genetic labeling and imaging methods to examine synaptic proteins in individual excitatory synapses across all regions of the mouse brain. Synapse catalogs were generated from the molecular and morphological features of a billion synapses. Each synapse subtype showed a unique anatomical distribution, and each brain region showed a distinct signature of synapse subtypes. Whole-brain synaptome cartography revealed spatial architecture from dendritic to global systems levels and previously unknown anatomical features. Synaptome mapping of circuits showed correspondence between synapse diversity and structural and functional connectomes. Behaviorally relevant patterns of neuronal activity trigger spatiotemporal postsynaptic responses sensitive to the structure of synaptome maps. Areas controlling higher cognitive function contain the greatest synapse diversity, and mutations causing cognitive disorders reorganized synaptome maps. Synaptome technology and resources have wide-ranging application in studies of the normal and diseased brain. Synapse molecular composition and diversity was systematically mapped across the whole mouse brain. A molecular logic orchestrates the spatial architecture of synapse diversity from individual dendrites to the systems level. Synaptome architecture and function is important for cognition and disease.', 'Respiration and brain neural dynamics associated with interval timing during odor fear learning in rats. In fear conditioning, where a conditioned stimulus predicts the arrival of an aversive stimulus, the animal encodes the time interval between the two stimuli. Here we monitored respiration to visualize anticipatory behavioral responses in an odor fear conditioning in rats, while recording theta (5–15\\xa0Hz) and gamma (40–80\\xa0Hz) brain oscillatory activities in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and olfactory piriform cortex (PIR). We investigated the temporal patterns of respiration frequency and of theta and gamma activity power during the odor-shock interval, comparing two interval durations. We found that akin to respiration patterns, theta temporal curves were modulated by the duration of the odor-shock interval in the four recording sites, and respected scalar property in mPFC and DMS. In contrast, gamma temporal curves were modulated by the interval duration only in the mPFC, and in a manner that did not respect scalar property. This suggests a preferential role for theta rhythm in interval timing. In addition, our data bring the novel idea that the respiratory rhythm might take part in the setting of theta activity dynamics related to timing.', 'Nanoscale exploration of the extracellular space in the live brain by combining single carbon nanotube tracking and super-resolution imaging analysis. The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a system of narrow compartments whose intricate nanometric structure has remained elusive until very recently. Understanding such a complex organisation represents a technological challenge that requires a technique able to resolve these nanoscopic spaces and simultaneously characterize their rheological properties. We recently used single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as near-infrared fluorescent probes to map with nanoscale precision the local organization and rheology of the ECS. Here we expand our method by tracking single nanotubes through super-resolution imaging in rat organotypic hippocampal slices and acute brain slices from adult mice, pioneering the exploration of the adult brain ECS at the nanoscale. We found a highly heterogeneous ECS, where local rheological properties can change drastically within few nanometres. Our results suggest differences in local ECS diffusion environments in organotypic slices when compared to adult mouse slices. Data obtained from super-resolved maps of the SWCNT trajectories indicate that ECS widths may vary between brain tissue models, with a looser, less crowded nano-environment in organotypic cultured slices.', \"Non-pharmacological factors that determine drug use and addiction. Based on their pharmacological properties, psychoactive drugs are supposed to take control of the natural reward system to finally drive compulsory drug seeking and consumption. However, psychoactive drugs are not used in an arbitrary way as pure pharmacological reinforcement would suggest, but rather in a highly specific manner depending on non-pharmacological factors. While pharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs are well studied, neurobiological mechanisms of non-pharmacological factors are less well understood. Here we review the emerging neurobiological mechanisms beyond pharmacological reinforcement which determine drug effects and use frequency. Important progress was made on the understanding of how the character of an environment and social stress determine drug self-administration. This is expanded by new evidence on how behavioral alternatives and opportunities for drug instrumentalization generate different patterns of drug choice. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurobiology of non-pharmacological factors strongly determines pharmacological and behavioral drug action and may, thus, give rise for an expanded system's approach of psychoactive drug use and addiction.\", 'Maternal dietary omega-3 deficiency worsens the deleterious effects of prenatal inflammation on the gut-brain axis in the offspring across lifetime. Maternal immune activation (MIA) and poor maternal nutritional habits are risk factors for the occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Human studies show the deleterious impact of prenatal inflammation and low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on neurodevelopment with long-lasting consequences on behavior. However, the mechanisms linking maternal nutritional status to MIA are still unclear, despite their relevance to the etiology of NDD. We demonstrate here that low maternal n-3 PUFA intake worsens MIA-induced early gut dysfunction, including modification of gut microbiota composition and higher local inflammatory reactivity. These deficits correlate with alterations of microglia-neuron crosstalk pathways and have long-lasting effects, both at transcriptional and behavioral levels. This work highlights the perinatal period as a critical time window, especially regarding the role of the gut-brain axis in neurodevelopment, elucidating the link between MIA, poor nutritional habits, and NDD.', 'EVolution: An edge-based variational method for non-rigid multi-modal image registration. Image registration is part of a large variety of medical applications including diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and/or treatment effectiveness and, more recently, therapy guidance. Such applications usually involve several imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging, either separately or combined. In the current work, we propose a non-rigid multi-modal registration method (namely EVolution: an edge-based variational method for non-rigid multi-modal image registration) that aims at maximizing edge alignment between the images being registered. The proposed algorithm requires only contrasts between physiological tissues, preferably present in both image modalities, and assumes deformable/elastic tissues. Given both is shown to be well suitable for non-rigid co-registration across different image types/contrasts (T1/T2) as well as different modalities (CT/MRI). This is achieved using a variational scheme that provides a fast algorithm with a low number of control parameters. Results obtained on an annotated CT data set were comparable to the ones provided by state-of-the-art multi-modal image registration algorithms, for all tested experimental conditions (image pre-filtering, image intensity variation, noise perturbation). Moreover, we demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, our method possesses increased robustness to transient structures (i.e. that are only present in some of the images).', \"Multi-scale graph-based grading for Alzheimer's disease prediction. The prediction of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically relevant, and may above all have a significant impact on accelerating the development of new treatments. In this paper, we present a new MRI-based biomarker that enables us to accurately predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD. In order to better capture the AD signature, we introduce two main contributions. First, we present a new graph-based grading framework to combine inter-subject similarity features and intra-subject variability features. This framework involves patch-based grading of anatomical structures and graph-based modeling of structure alteration relationships. Second, we propose an innovative multiscale brain analysis to capture alterations caused by AD at different anatomical levels. Based on a cascade of classifiers, this multiscale approach enables the analysis of alterations of whole brain structures and hippocampus subfields at the same time. During our experiments using the ADNI-1 dataset, the proposed multiscale graph-based grading method obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81% to predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD within three years. Moreover, when combined with cognitive scores, the proposed method obtained 85% of AUC. These results are competitive in comparison to state-of-the-art methods evaluated on the same dataset.\", 'Mouse models of 17q21.31 microdeletion and microduplication syndromes highlight the importance of Kansl1 for cognition. Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) is a multi-system disorder characterized by intellectual disability, friendly behavior, and congenital malformations. The syndrome is caused either by microdeletions in the 17q21.31 chromosomal region or by variants in the KANSL1 gene. The reciprocal 17q21.31 microduplication syndrome is associated with psychomotor delay, and reduced social interaction. To investigate the pathophysiology of 17q21.31 microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, we generated three mouse models: 1) the deletion (Del/+); or 2) the reciprocal duplication (Dup/+) of the 17q21.31 syntenic region; and 3) a heterozygous Kansl1 (Kans1+/-) model. We found altered weight, general activity, social behaviors, object recognition, and fear conditioning memory associated with craniofacial and brain structural changes observed in both Del/+ and Dup/+ animals. By investigating hippocampus function, we showed synaptic transmission defects in Del/+ and Dup/+ mice. Mutant mice with a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in Kansl1 displayed similar behavioral and anatomical phenotypes compared to Del/+ mice with the exception of sociability phenotypes. Genes controlling chromatin organization, synaptic transmission and neurogenesis were upregulated in the hippocampus of Del/+ and Kansl1+/-animals. Our results demonstrate the implication of KANSL1 in the manifestation of KdVS phenotypes and extend substantially our knowledge about biological processes affected by these mutations. Clear differences in social behavior and gene expression profiles between Del/+ and Kansl1+/-mice suggested potential roles of other genes affected by the 17q21.31 deletion. Together, these novel mouse models provide new genetic tools valuable for the development of therapeutic approaches.', 'Automatic Frequency-Shift Detection in the Auditory System: A Review of Psychophysical Findings. The human brain has the task of binding successive sounds produced by the same acoustic source into a coherent perceptual stream, and binding must be selective when several sources are concurrently active. Binding appears to obey a principle of spectral proximity: pure tones close in frequency are more likely to be bound than pure tones with remote frequencies. It has been hypothesized that the binding process is realized by automatic “frequency-shift detectors” (FSDs), comparable to the detectors of spatial motion in the visual system. In 2005, this hypothesis was supported by a psychophysical study showing that human listeners are able to identify the direction of a frequency shift between two successive pure tones while the first of these tones is not audible individually due to informational masking by other tones presented synchronously. A number of variants of this study have been performed since 2005, in order to confirm the existence of FSDs, to characterize their properties, and to clarify as far as possible their neural underpinnings. The results obtained up to now suggest that the working of the FSDs exploits an implicit sensory memory which is powerful with respect to both capacity and retention time. Tones within chords can be perceptually enhanced by small frequency shifts, in a manner suggesting that the FSDs can serve in auditory scene analysis not only as binding tools but also, to a limited extent, as segregation tools.', \"Jmy regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation via modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. During central nervous system development, oligodendrocytes form structurally and functionally distinct actin-rich protrusions that contact and wrap around axons to assemble myelin sheaths. Establishment of axonal contact is a limiting step in myelination that relies on the oligodendrocyte's ability to locally coordinate cytoskeletal rearrangements with myelin production, under the control of a transcriptional differentiation program. The molecules that provide fine-tuning of actin dynamics during oligodendrocyte differentiation and axon ensheathment remain largely unidentified. We performed transcriptomics analysis of soma and protrusion fractions from rat brain oligodendrocyte progenitors and found a subcellular enrichment of mRNAs in newly-formed protrusions. Approximately 30% of protrusion-enriched transcripts encode proteins related to cytoskeleton dynamics, including the junction mediating and regulatory protein Jmy, a multifunctional regulator of actin polymerization. Here, we show that expression of Jmy is upregulated during myelination and is required for the assembly of actin filaments and protrusion formation during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Quantitative morphodynamics analysis of live oligodendrocytes showed that differentiation is driven by a stereotypical actin network-dependent “cellular shaping” program. Disruption of actin dynamics via knockdown of Jmy leads to a program fail resulting in oligodendrocytes that do not acquire an arborized morphology and are less efficient in contacting neurites and forming myelin wraps in co-cultures with neurons. Our findings provide new mechanistic insight into the relationship between cell shape dynamics and differentiation in development.\", 'Numerical cognition: A meta-analysis of neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain-damaged patients studies. This article offers the first comprehensive review examining the neurocognitive bases of numerical cognition from neuroimaging, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and brain-damaged patients studies. We focused on the predictions derived from the Triple Code Model (TCM), particularly the assumption that the representation of numerical quantities rests on a single format-independent representation (i.e., the analogical code) involving both intraparietal sulci (IPS). To do so, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 28 neuroimaging, 12 TMS and 12 brain-damaged patients studies, including arithmetic and magnitude tasks in symbolic and non-symbolic formats. Our findings generally agree with the TCM predictions indicating that both IPS are engaged in all tasks. Nonetheless, the results of brain-damaged patients studies conflicted with neuroimaging and TMS studies, suggesting a right hemisphere lateralization for non-symbolic formats. Our findings also led us to discuss the involvement of brain regions other than IPS in the processing of the analogical code as well as the neural substrate of other codes underlying numerical cognition (i.e., the auditory-verbal code).', 'Social harassment induces anxiety-like behaviour in crayfish. Social interactions leading to dominance hierarchies often elicit psychological disorders in mammals including harassment and anxiety. Here, we demonstrate that this sequence also occurs in an invertebrate, the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. When placed in the restricted space of an aquarium, crayfish dyads generally fight until one of the opponents suddenly escapes, thereafter clearly expressing a submissive behaviour. Nevertheless, the winner frequently keeps on displaying excessive aggressive acts, having deleterious consequences in losers and interpreted as harassment behaviour. We indeed observed that, contrary to winners, losers expressed anxiety-like behaviour (ALB) in correlation with the stress intensity they suffered during the harassment period mainly. Injections of an anxiolytic abolished ALB, confirming its homology with anxiety. A serotonin (5-HT) antagonist had the same effect, suggesting a role for 5-HT, whose brain concentrations increased much more in losers than in winners. Our findings suggest that the bases of harassment and of its anxiogenic consequences have emerged very early during evolution, and emphasize crayfish as an unexpected but potentially fruitful model for the study of these social disorders.', 'Artificial intelligence to predict clinical disability in patients with multiple sclerosis using FLAIR MRI. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to create an algorithm that combines multiple machine-learning techniques to predict the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of patients with multiple sclerosis at two years solely based on age, sex and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI data. Materials and methods: Our algorithm combined several complementary predictors: a pure deep learning predictor based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns from the images, as well as classical machine-learning predictors based on random forest regressors and manifold learning trained using the location of lesion load with respect to white matter tracts. The aggregation of the predictors was done through a weighted average taking into account prediction errors for different EDSS ranges. The training dataset consisted of 971 multiple sclerosis patients from the “Observatoire français de la sclérose en plaques” (OFSEP) cohort with initial FLAIR MRI and corresponding EDSS score at two years. A test dataset (475 subjects) was provided without an EDSS score. Ten percent of the training dataset was used for validation. Results: Our algorithm predicted EDSS score in patients with multiple sclerosis and achieved a MSE = 2.2 with the validation dataset and a MSE = 3 (mean EDSS error = 1.7) with the test dataset. Conclusion: Our method predicts two-year clinical disability in patients with multiple sclerosis with a mean EDSS score error of 1.7, using FLAIR sequence and basic patient demographics. This supports the use of our model to predict EDSS score progression. These promising results should be further validated on an external validation cohort.', 'Tumor-Like Presentation of Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System. Background and Purpose - We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of patients with tumor-like presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Methods - We retrospectively analyzed 10 patients enrolled in the French primary angiitis of the central nervous system cohort, who initially presented tumor-like brain lesions and compared them with other patients within the cohort. Results - The 10 patients with tumor-like presentation in the cohort were younger and had more seizures at diagnosis than the other 75 patients (median of 37 [30-48] years versus 46 [18-79] years; P=0.008; 9 [90%] with seizures versus 22 [29%], P<0.001; respectively). All 10 patients had a biopsy (stereotactic procedure in 7 and open-wedge surgery in 3). Histological findings suggestive of vasculitis were observed in 9 patients in whom conventional cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance angiography were negative. In the remaining patient, vascular imaging demonstrated diffuse bilateral large- and medium-sized vessel involvement (biopsy did not reveal vasculitis). All patients with tumor-like presentation received glucocorticoids, combined with cyclophosphamide in 9 cases. With a median follow-up of 27 (12-130) months, 5 (50%) patients relapsed, but achieved remission again after treatment intensification. Conclusions - Patients with tumor-like presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system represent a subgroup characterized with mainly small-sized vessel disease that requires histological confirmation because vascular imaging is often normal. Although relapses are not uncommon, global outcomes are good under treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.', 'Prism adaptation alters electrophysiological markers of attentional processes in the healthy brain. Neglect patients typically show a rightward attentional orienting bias and a strong disengagement deficit, such that they are especially slow in responding to left-sided targets after right-sided cues (Posner et al., 1984). Prism adaptation (PA) can reduce diverse debilitating neglect symptoms and it has been hypothesized that PA’s effects are so generalized that they might be mediated by attentional mechanisms (Pisella et al., 2006; Redding and Wallace, 2006). In neglect patients, performance on spatial attention tasks improves after rightward-deviatingPA(Jacquin-Courtois et al., 2013). In contrast, in healthy subjects, although there is evidence that leftward-deviating PA induces neglect-like performance on some visuospatial tasks, behavioral studies of spatial attention tasks have mostly yielded negative results (Morris et al., 2004; Bultitude et al., 2013). We hypothesized that these negative behavioral findings might reflect the limitations of behavioral measures in healthy subjects. Here we exploited the sensitivity of event-related potentials to test the hypothesis that electrophysiological markers of attentional processes in the healthy human brain are affected by PA. Leftward-deviating PA generated asymmetries in attentional orienting (reflected in the cue-locked N1) and in attentional disengagement for invalidly cued left targets (reflected in the target-locked P1). This is the first electrophysiological demonstration that leftward-deviating PA in healthy subjects mimics attentional patterns typically seen in neglect patients.', 'Risk factors for intraoperative allogeneic blood transfusion during craniotomy for brain tumor removal in children. Summary Background Several clinical and surgical factors can influence the occurrence of allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) during oncologic neurosurgery. Objectives To identify the potential predictive factors of ABT during craniotomy for the removal of brain tumors in children and the potential impact of intraoperative ABT on early postoperative outcome. Methods A retrospective study was performed in all pediatric patients younger than 18 years who underwent craniotomy for brain tumor removal from December 2009 to December 2012 in our institution. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected from medical and stored electronic anesthesia records. The predictors of intraoperative ABT were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results A total of 110 patients were included. Twenty-seven patients (25%) received intraoperative ABT with a volume of 16 ± 8 ml·kg-1. On multivariate analysis, an age <4 years, a duration of surgery >270 min, and a preoperative hemoglobin <12.2 g·dl-1 were independently associated with the need for intraoperative ABT. We did not show any significant difference concerning postoperative early outcome and length of stay between the transfused and non-transfused patients except for the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation that was significantly higher in the transfused group (P = 0.04). Conclusion In children, craniotomy for brain tumor removal is at risk of intraoperative ABT. An age <4 years, a duration of surgery >270 min, and a preoperative hemoglobin <12.2 g·dl-1 are the main factors associated with intraoperative ABT during this surgery.', 'Transient Ischemic Attack and Minor Stroke: Definitively Not So Harmless for the Brain and Cognitive Functions. ', 'Remote brain hemorrhage after IV thrombolysis: Role of preexisting lesions. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that remote intracerebral hemorrhages (r-ICHs) after IV thrombolysis occur in preexisting brain lesions.MethodWe prospectively collected baseline data from consecutive patients treated with IV thrombolysis for cerebral ischemia and reviewed their baseline MRI scans to identify preexisting lesions in those who developed r-ICH. We evaluated outcomes with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and defined good outcomes as scores of 0 to 2 or similar to the preexisting mRS score.ResultsOf 944 patients, 24 (2.5%) had r-ICH: lobar in 14, deep in 7, and both in 3. Sixteen of them (1.7% of all patients, 66.7% of those with r-ICH) were asymptomatic. Of the 41 r-ICHs found in these patients, 17 (41%) occurred within a lesion present before thrombolysis: 6 cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), 6 old and 1 recent infarct, and 4 areas of white matter hyperintensity. Patients with r-ICH were more likely to have strictly lobar CMBs (p = 0.049). They were 10 years older (p = 0.007), had a 16-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.035) at baseline, and had more CMBs (p = 0.007). r-ICHs were better predicted by clinical (age, baseline systolic blood pressure) than imaging (purely lobar CMBs and having >5 CMBs) variables. r-ICHs tended to be associated with worse outcomes.ConclusionWe identified preexisting brain lesions in nearly half of the patients with r-ICH. All were of vascular origin, supporting the hypothesis that r-ICHs occur in preexisting brain lesions. Higher-field machines could help identifying preexisting lesions in those who developed r-ICH in an apparently normal area.', 'Maternal obesity alters social brain programming by altering gut microbiota in progeny. ', 'Leptin brain entry via a tanycytic LepR–EGFR shuttle controls lipid metabolism and pancreas function. Metabolic health depends on the brain’s ability to control food intake and nutrient use versus storage, processes that require peripheral signals such as the adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, to cross brain barriers and mobilize regulatory circuits. We have previously shown that hypothalamic tanycytes shuttle leptin into the brain to reach target neurons. Here, using multiple complementary models, we show that tanycytes express functional leptin receptor (LepR), respond to leptin by triggering Ca2+ waves and target protein phosphorylation, and that their transcytotic transport of leptin requires the activation of a LepR–EGFR complex by leptin and EGF sequentially. Selective deletion of LepR in tanycytes blocks leptin entry into the brain, inducing not only increased food intake and lipogenesis but also glucose intolerance through attenuated insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells, possibly via altered sympathetic nervous tone. Tanycytic LepRb–EGFR-mediated transport of leptin could thus be crucial to the pathophysiology of diabetes in addition to obesity, with therapeutic implications.', 'LPS-induced histone H3 phospho(Ser10)-acetylation(Lys14) regulates neuronal and microglial neuroinflammatory response. Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone proteins are emerging as fundamental mechanisms by which neural cells adapt their transcriptional response to environmental cues, such as, immune stimuli or stress. In particular, histone H3 phospho(Ser10)-acetylation(Lys14) (H3S10phK14ac) has been linked to activation of specific gene expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of H3S10phK14ac in a neuroinflammatory condition. Adult male rats received a intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (830 μg/Kg/i.p., n = 6) or vehicle (saline 1 mL/kg/i.p., n = 6) and were sacrificed 2 or 6 h later. We showed marked region- and time-specific increases in H3S10phK14ac in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, two principal target regions of LPS. These changes were accompanied by a marked transcriptional activation of interleukin (IL) 1β IL-6, Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) α the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the immediate early gene c-Fos. By means of chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated an increased region- and time-specific association of H3S10phK14ac with the promoters of IL-6, c-Fos and iNOS genes, suggesting that part of the LPS-induced transcriptional activation of these genes is regulated by H3S10phK14ac. Finally, by means of multiple immunofluorescence approach, we showed that increased H3S10phK14ac is cell type-specific, being neurons and reactive microglia, the principal histological types involved in this response. Present data point to H3S10phK14ac as a principal epigenetic regulator of neural cell response to systemic LPS and underline the importance of distinct time-, region- and cell-specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene transcription to understand the mechanistic complexity of neuroinflammatory response to immune challenges.', 'Radionecrosis after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. Introduction: Radionecrosis (RN) represents the main complication of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases. It may be observed in up to 34% of cases at 24 months after treatment and associated with significant morbidity in 10-17%. Areas covered: Our aim is to discuss the results of original studies on RN related to SRT for brain metastases. Expert commentary: Although the development of RN is unpredictable, larger volume of the lesion, prior whole brain irradiation, and higher dose of radiation represent the major risk factors. RN appears on MRI as contrast-enhancing necrotic lesions, surrounded by edema, occurring at least 3 months after SRT, localized within fields of irradiation. No firm criteria are established. Surgery can provide symptomatic relief but is associated with a risk of complications. Corticosteroids are considered the standard of care treatment, despite limited efficacy and many adverse effects. Bevacizumab represents another interesting option that needs to be validated.', 'Effect of informed consent on patient characteristics in a stroke thrombolysis trial. Objective: To determine whether the manner of consent, i.e., informed consent by patients themselves or informed consent by proxy, affects clinical characteristics of samples of acute stroke patients enrolled in clinical trials. Methods: We analyzed the manner of obtaining informed consent in the first 1,005 patients from WAKE-UP, an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset running in 6 European countries. Patients providing informed consent by themselves were compared with patients enrolled by proxy consent. Baseline clinical measures were compared between groups. Results: In 359 (35.7%) patients, informed consent was by proxy. Patients with proxy consent were older (median 71 vs 66 years, p < 0.0001) and had a higher frequency of arterial hypertension (58.2% vs 43.4%, p < 0.0001). They showed higher scores on the NIH Stroke Scale (median 11 vs 5, p < 0.0001) and more frequently aphasia (73.7% vs 20.0%, p < 0.0001). The rate of proxy consent varied among countries (p < 0.0001), ranging from 77.1% in Spain to 1.2% in Denmark. Conclusions: Patients recruited by proxy consent were older, had more severe strokes, and had higher prevalence of aphasia than those with capacity to give personal consent. Variations in the manner of consent across countries may influence trial results.

It is now well established that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only a movement disorder of the CNS but also a gastrointestinal disorder affecting the enteric nervous system (ENS). The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, which comprises besides the CNS and the ENS, the intestinal epithelial barrier, the intestinal microbiota and the enteroendocrine systems. In this review, we present the clinical and pathological evidence suggesting that the gut-brain axis is dysfunctional in PD by discussing the possible role of gut microbiota, inflammation and permeability in the development of the disease.\", 'Patterns of brain atrophy associated with episodic memory and semantic fluency decline in aging. The cerebral substratum of age-related cognitive decline was evaluated in an elderly-cohort followed for 12 years (n=306). Participants, free of dementia, received neuropsychological assessments every two years and an MRI exam at baseline and four years later. Cognitive decline was evaluated on two broadly used tests to detect dementia: the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), a verbal episodic memory task, and the Isaacs Set Test (IST), a semantic fluency task. Using voxel-based approach, the relationship between cognitive decline with 1/ baseline grey matter volumes and 2/ grey matter volume loss between the two scans was explored. Baseline volumes analysis revealed that FCSRT and IST declines were both associated with lower volumes of the medial temporal region. Volumes loss analysis confirmed that both declines are related to medial temporal lobe atrophy and revealed that FCSRT decline was specifically associated with atrophy of the posterior cingulate cortex whereas IST decline was specifically related to temporal pole atrophy. These results suggest that cognitive decline across aging is firstly related to structural modifications of the medial temporal lobe, followed by an atrophy in the posterior midline structures for episodic memory and an atrophy of the temporal pole for semantic fluency.', 'Picalm reduction exacerbates tau pathology in a murine tauopathy model. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified PICALM as one of the most significant susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) after APOE and BIN1. PICALM is a clathrin-adaptor protein and plays critical roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and in autophagy. PICALM modulates brain amyloid ß (Aß) pathology and tau accumulation. We have previously reported that soluble PICALM protein level is reduced in correlation with abnormalities of autophagy markers in the affected brain areas of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, sporadic tauopathies and familial cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-tau) with mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. It remains unclarified whether in vivo PICALM reduction could either trigger or influence tau pathology progression in the brain. In this study, we confirmed a significant reduction of soluble PICALM protein and autophagy deficits in the post-mortem human brains of FTLD-tau-MAPT (P301L, S364S and L266V). We generated a novel transgenic mouse line named Tg30xPicalm+/−\\xa0by crossing Tg30 tau transgenic mice with Picalm-haploinsufficient mice to test whether Picalm reduction may modulate tau pathology. While Picalm haploinsufficiency did not lead to any motor phenotype or detectable tau pathology in mouse brains, Tg30xPicalm+/− mice developed markedly more severe motor deficits than Tg30 by the age of 9\\xa0months. Tg30xPicalm+/− had significantly higher pathological tau levels in the brain, an increased density of neurofibrillary tangles compared to Tg30 mice and increased abnormalities of autophagy markers. Our results demonstrate that Picalm haploinsufficiency in transgenic Tg30 mice significantly aggravated tau pathologies and tau-mediated neurodegeneration, supporting a role for changes in Picalm expression as a risk/sensitizing factor for development of tau pathology and as a mechanism underlying the AD risk associated to PICALM.', 'Attenuation and Delay of Remote Potentials Evoked by Direct Electrical Stimulation During Brain Surgery. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) is used to perform functional brain mapping during awake surgery but its electrophysiological effects remain by far unknown. DES may be coupled with the measurement of evoked potentials (EPs) to study the conductive and integrative properties of activated neural ensembles and probe the spatiotemporal dynamics of short- and long-range networks. We recorded ECoG signals on two patients undergoing awake brain surgery and measured EPs on functional sites after cortical stimulations, using combinations of stimulation parameters. EPs were similar in shape but delayed in time and attenuated in amplitude when elicited from a different gyrus or remotely from the recording site. We were able to trigger remote EPs using low stimulation intensities. We propose different activation and electrophysiological propagation mechanisms following DES based on activated neural elements.', 'Expression of CD300lf by microglia contributes to resistance to cerebral malaria by impeding the neuroinflammation. Genetic mapping and genome-wide studies provide evidence for the association of several genetic polymorphisms with malaria, a complex pathological disease with multiple severity degrees. We have previously described Berr1and Berr2 as candidate genes identified in the WLA/Pas inbreed mouse strain predisposing to resistance to cerebral malaria (CM) induced by P. berghei ANKA. We report in this study the phenotypic and functional characteristics of a congenic strain we have derived for Berr2WLA allele on the C57BL/6JR (B6) background. B6.WLA-Berr2 was found highly resistant to CM compared to C57BL/6JR susceptible mice. The mechanisms associated with CM resistance were analyzed by combining genotype, transcriptomic and immune response studies. We found that B6.WLA-Berr2 mice showed a reduced parasite sequestration and blood–brain barrier disruption with low CXCR3+ T cell infiltration in the brain along with altered glial cell response upon P. berghei ANKA infection compared to B6. In addition, we have identified the CD300f, belonging to a family of Ig-like encoding genes, as a potential candidate associated with CM resistance. Microglia cells isolated from the brain of infected B6.WLA-Berr2 mice significantly expressed higher level of CD300f compared to CMS mice and were associated with inhibition of inflammatory response.', 'A TCRβ Repertoire Signature Can Predict Experimental Cerebral Malaria. Cerebral Malaria (CM) is associated with a pathogenic T cell response. Mice infected by P. berghei ANKA clone 1.49 (PbA) developing CM(CM+) present an altered PBL TCR repertoire, partly due to recurrently expanded T cell clones, as compared to non-infected and CMinfected mice. To analyse the relationship between repertoire alteration and CM, we performed a kinetic analysis of the TRBV repertoire during the course of the infection until CMrelated death in PbA-infected mice. The repertoires of PBL, splenocytes and brain lymphocytes were compared between infected and non-infectedmice using a high-throughput CDR3 spectratyping method. We observed a modification of the whole TCR repertoire in the spleen and blood of infected mice, fromthe fifth and the sixth day post-infection, respectively, while only three TRBV were significantly perturbed in the brain of infectedmice. Usingmultivariate analysis and statistical modelling, we identified a unique TCRâ signature discriminating CM+ from CTR mice, enriched during the course of the infection in the spleen and the blood and predicting CM onset. These results highlight a dynamic modification and compartmentalization of the TCR diversity during the course of PbA infection, and provide a novel method to identify disease-associated TCRâ signature as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Alterations in heart-brain interactions under mild stress during a cognitive task are reflected in entropy of heart rate dynamics. Many people experience mild stress in modern society which raises the need for an improved understanding of psychophysiological responses to stressors. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be associated with a flexible network of intricate neural structures which are dynamically organized to cope with diverse challenges. HRV was obtained in thirty-three healthy participants performing a cognitive task both with and without added stressors. Markers of neural autonomic control and neurovisceral complexity (entropy) were computed from HRV time series. Based on individual anxiety responses to the experimental stressors, two subgroups were identified: anxiety responders and non-responders. While both vagal and entropy markers rose during the cognitive task alone in both subgroups, only entropy decreased when stressors were added and exclusively in anxiety responders. We conclude that entropy may be a promising marker of cognitive tasks and acute mild stress. It brings out a new central question: why is entropy the only marker affected by mild stress? Based on the neurovisceral integration model, we hypothesized that neurophysiological complexity may be altered by mild stress, which is reflected in entropy of the cardiac output signal. The putative role of the amygdala during mild stress, in modulating the complexity of a coordinated neural network linking brain to heart, is discussed.', \"A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of theory of mind impairments in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Although patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) are known to have theory of mind (ToM) impairments, the latter's neural functional bases have yet to be explored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to gain insights into the neural dysfunction associated with ToM impairments in patients with mTLE. Twenty-five patients (12 and 13 with right and left mTLE, respectively) and 25 healthy controls performed the “animated shapes” task during fMRI. This complex ToM task requires both explicit reasoning about mental states and implicit processing of information on biological motion and action. The animated shapes evoke both ToM and non-ToM interaction perception, and the corresponding neural activation patterns were compared. Behavioral performance (i.e. categorization of the interactions) was also recorded. Relative to healthy controls, both patients with right and left mTLE were impaired in categorizing ToM interactions. The fMRI results showed that both patients with right and left mTLE had less intense neural activation (relative to controls) in regions involved in the implicit component of ToM processes (i.e. the fusiform gyrus in patients with right mTLE and the supplementary motor area in patients with left mTLE). In patients with right mTLE, we also observed more intense activation (relative to controls) in regions involved in the explicit component of ToM processes (i.e. the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex); age at onset of epilepsy also mediated activation in regions involved in the explicit component (i.e. the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction). Patients with left mTLE displayed greater activation of the contralateral mesial regions (relative to controls); we speculate that this may correspond to the deployment of a compensatory mechanism. This study provides insights into the disturbances of the implicit/explicit ToM neural network in patients with mTLE. These impairments in the ToM neural network depend on clinical characteristics, such as the laterality (right or left mTLE) and the age at onset of epilepsy.\", \"A 15-day course of donepezil modulates spectral EEG dynamics related to target auditory stimuli in young, healthy adult volunteers. Objective: To identify possible electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of donepezil's effect on cortical activity in young, healthy adult volunteers at the group level. Methods: Thirty subjects were administered a daily dose of either 5 mg donepezil or placebo for 15 days in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial. The electroencephalogram during an auditory oddball paradigm was recorded from 58 scalp electrodes. Current source density (CSD) transformations were applied to EEG epochs. The event-related potential (ERP), inter-trial coherence (ITC: the phase consistency of the EEG spectrum) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP: the EEG power spectrum relative to the baseline) were calculated for the target (oddball) stimuli. Results: The donepezil and placebo conditions differed in terms of the changes in delta/theta/alpha/beta ITC and ERSP in various regions of the scalp (especially the frontal electrodes) but not in terms of latency and amplitude of the P300-ERP component. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ITC and ERSP analyses can provide EEG markers of donepezil's effects in young, healthy, adult volunteers at a group level. Significance: Novel EEG markers could be useful to assess the therapeutic potential of drug candidates in Alzheimer's disease in healthy volunteers prior to the initiation of Phase II/III clinical studies in patients.\", \"Upregulated energy metabolism in the Drosophila mushroom body is the trigger for long-term memory. Efficient energy use has constrained the evolution of nervous systems. However, it is unresolved whether energy metabolism may resultantly regulate major brain functions. Our observation that Drosophila flies double their sucrose intake at an early stage of long-term memory formation initiated the investigation of how energy metabolism intervenes in this process. Cellular-resolution imaging of energy metabolism reveals a concurrent elevation of energy consumption in neurons of the mushroom body, the fly's major memory centre. Strikingly, upregulation of mushroom body energy flux is both necessary and sufficient to drive long-term memory formation. This effect is triggered by a specific pair of dopaminergic neurons afferent to the mushroom bodies, via the D5-like DAMB dopamine receptor. Hence, dopamine signalling mediates an energy switch in the mushroom body that controls long-term memory encoding. Our data thus point to an instructional role for energy flux in the execution of demanding higher brain functions.\", 'Brain MRI features and scoring of leukodystrophy in adult-onset Krabbe disease. ObjectiveTo perform a systematic analysis and scoring of brain MRI white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in adult-onset Krabbe disease.MethodsWe retrospectively collected basic clinical data and the first available brain MRI from patients with confirmed Krabbe disease with first clinical manifestations beyond 10 years of age. Data were obtained from our reference center for lysosomal diseases (n = 6) and from contacted authors of published articles describing patients with adult-onset Krabbe disease (n = 15). T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of each patient were analyzed and scored using a radiologic score of WMH in a single center.ResultsThe corticospinal tract was always affected by WMH (100% of patients), however, with some distinctions along the tract: the precentral gyrus (100%), corona radiata (95%), and posterior internal capsule (81%) were highly abnormal, whereas the mesencephalon (57%), pons (52%), and medulla oblongata (5%) were less affected. WMH were also frequently present in the posterior lateral periventricular white matter (95%), optic radiations (86%), postcentral gyrus (71%), medial lemniscus (62%), and corpus callosum, especially in the isthmus (71%), whereas the genu was always normal. A few patients did not have the classical MRI pattern but extensive hyperintensities (n = 3), or patchy distribution of hyperintensities mimicking an acquired etiology (n = 2), or very subtle hyperintensities of the corticospinal tract (n = 1).ConclusionsWe specified the main locations of WMH, which were observed in the earliest stages of the disease and were also present in patients with atypical MRI pattern, highlighting the importance of radiologic features to guide the diagnosis.', 'Brain network connectivity associated with anticipatory postural control in children and adults. Internal models provide a coherent framework for understanding motor behavior. Examples for the use of internal models include anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), where the individual anticipates and cancels out the destabilizing effect of movement on body posture. Yet little is known about the functional changes in the brain supporting the development of APAs. Here, we addressed this issue by relating individual differences in APAs as assessed during bimanual load lifting to interindividual variation in brain network interactions at rest. We showed that the strength of the connectivity between three main canonical brain networks, namely the cingulo-opercular, the fronto-parietal and the somatosensory-motor networks, is an index of the ability to implement APAs from late childhood (9- to 11-year-old children). We also found an effect of age on the relationship between APAs and coupling strength between these networks, consistent with the notion that APAs are near but not yet fully mature in children. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of learning disorders with impairment in predictive motor control.', 'Partial homologies between sleep states in lizards, mammals, and birds suggest a complex evolution of sleep states in amniotes. It is crucial to determine whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS) (or non-REM sleep), identified in most mammals and birds, also exist in lizards, as they share a common ancestor with these groups. Recently, a study in the bearded dragon (P. vitticeps) reported states analogous to REM and SWS alternating in a surprisingly regular 80-s period, suggesting a common origin of the two sleep states across amniotes. We first confirmed these results in the bearded dragon with deep brain recordings and electro-oculogram (EOG) recordings. Then, to confirm a common origin and more finely characterize sleep in lizards, we developed a multiparametric approach in the tegu lizard, a species never recorded to date. We recorded EOG, electromyogram (EMG), heart rate, and local field potentials (LFPs) and included data on arousal thresholds, sleep deprivation, and pharmacological treatments with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake blocker that suppresses REM sleep in mammals. As in the bearded dragon, we demonstrate the existence of two sleep states in tegu lizards. However, no clear periodicity is apparent. The first sleep state (S1 sleep) showed high-amplitude isolated sharp waves, and the second sleep state (S2 sleep) displayed 15-Hz oscillations, isolated ocular movements, and a decrease in heart rate variability and muscle tone compared to S1. Fluoxetine treatment induced a significant decrease in S2 quantities and in the number of sharp waves in S1. Because S2 sleep is characterized by the presence of ocular movements and is inhibited by a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as is REM sleep in birds and mammals, it might be analogous to this state. However, S2 displays a type of oscillation never previously reported and does not display a desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) as is observed in the bearded dragons, mammals, and birds. This suggests that the phenotype of sleep states and possibly their role can differ even between closely related species. Finally, our results suggest a common origin of two sleep states in amniotes. Yet, they also highlight a diversity of sleep phenotypes across lizards, demonstrating that the evolution of sleep states is more complex than previously thought.', 'Dynamic changes of depolarizing GABA in a computational model of epileptogenic brain: Insight for Dravet syndrome. Abnormal reemergence of depolarizing GABA A current during postnatal brain maturation may play a major role in paediatric epilepsies, Dravet syndrome (DS) being among the most severe. To study the impact of depolarizing GABA onto distinct patterns of EEG activity, we extended a neural mass model as follows: one sub-population of pyramidal cells was added as well as two sub-populations of interacting interneurons, perisomatic-projecting interneurons (basket-like) with fast synaptic kinetics GABA A (fast, I1) and dendritic-projecting interneurons with slow synaptic kinetics GABA A (slow, I2). Basket-like cells were interconnected to reproduce mutual inhibition mechanisms (I1 → I1).The firing rate of interneurons was adapted to mimic the genetic alteration of voltage gated sodium channels found in DS patients, SCN1A +/- . We implemented the \"dynamic depolarizing GABA A \" mediated post-synaptic potential in the model, as some studies reported that the chloride reversal potential can switch from negative to more positive value depending on interneuron activity. The \"shunting inhibition\" promoted by GABA A receptor activation was also implemented.We found that increasing the proportion of depolarizing GABA A mediated IPSP (I1 → I1 and I1 → P) only (i.e., other parameters left unchanged) was sufficient to sequentially switch the EEG activity from background to (1) interictal isolated polymorphic epileptic spikes, (2) fast onset activity, (3) seizure like activity and (4) seizure termination. The interictal and ictal EEG patterns observed in 4 DS patients were reproduced by the model via tuning the amount of depolarizing GABA A postsynaptic potential. Finally, we implemented the modes of action of benzodiazepines and stiripentol, two drugs recommended in DS. Both drugs blocked seizure-like activity, partially and dose-dependently when applied separately, completely and with a synergic effect when combined, as has been observed in DS patients.This computational modeling study constitutes an innovative approach to better define the role of depolarizing GABA in infantile onset epilepsy and opens the way for new therapeutic hypotheses, especially in Dravet syndrome.', 'Consensus classification of posterior cortical atrophy. Introduction A classification framework for posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is proposed to improve the uniformity of definition of the syndrome in a variety of research settings. Methods Consensus statements about PCA were developed through a detailed literature review, the formation of an international multidisciplinary working party which convened on four occasions, and a Web-based quantitative survey regarding symptom frequency and the conceptualization of PCA. Results A three-level classification framework for PCA is described comprising both syndrome- and disease-level descriptions. Classification level 1 (PCA) defines the core clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging features and exclusion criteria of the clinico-radiological syndrome. Classification level 2 (PCA-pure, PCA-plus) establishes whether, in addition to the core PCA syndrome, the core features of any other neurodegenerative syndromes are present. Classification level 3 (PCA attributable to AD [PCA-AD], Lewy body disease [PCA-LBD], corticobasal degeneration [PCA-CBD], prion disease [PCA-prion]) provides a more formal determination of the underlying cause of the PCA syndrome, based on available pathophysiological biomarker evidence. The issue of additional syndrome-level descriptors is discussed in relation to the challenges of defining stages of syndrome severity and characterizing phenotypic heterogeneity within the PCA spectrum. Discussion There was strong agreement regarding the definition of the core clinico-radiological syndrome, meaning that the current consensus statement should be regarded as a refinement, development, and extension of previous single-center PCA criteria rather than any wholesale alteration or redescription of the syndrome. The framework and terminology may facilitate the interpretation of research data across studies, be applicable across a broad range of research scenarios (e.g., behavioral interventions, pharmacological trials), and provide a foundation for future collaborative work.', 'Glial markers and emotional memory in rats following acute cerebral radiofrequency exposures. The widespread mobile phone use raises concerns on the possible cerebral effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF). Reactive astrogliosis was reported in neuroanatomical structures of adaptive behaviors after a single RF EMF exposure at high specific absorption rate (SAR, 6\\xa0W/kg). Here, we aimed to assess if neuronal injury and functional impairments were related to high SAR-induced astrogliosis. In addition, the level of beta amyloid 1–40 (Aβ 1–40) peptide was explored as a possible toxicity marker. Sprague Dawley male rats were exposed for 15\\xa0min at 0, 1.5, or 6\\xa0W/kg or for 45\\xa0min at 6\\xa0W/kg. Memory, emotionality, and locomotion were tested in the fear conditioning, the elevated plus maze, and the open field. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, total and cytosolic fractions), myelin basic protein (MBP), and Aβ1–40 were quantified in six brain areas using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. According to our data, total GFAP was increased in the striatum (+114\\xa0%) at 1.5\\xa0W/kg. Long-term memory was reduced, and cytosolic GFAP was increased in the hippocampus (+119\\xa0%) and in the olfactory bulb (+46\\xa0%) at 6\\xa0W/kg (15\\xa0min). No MBP or Aβ1–40 expression modification was shown. Our data corroborates previous studies indicating RF EMF-induced astrogliosis. This study suggests that RF EMF-induced astrogliosis had functional consequences on memory but did not demonstrate that it was secondary to neuronal damage.', 'On the mechanical characterization and modeling of polymer gel brain substitute under dynamic rotational loading. The use of highly sensitive soft materials has become increasingly apparent in the last few years in numerous industrial fields, due to their viscous and damping nature. Unfortunately these materials remain difficult to characterize using conventional techniques, mainly because of the very low internal forces supported by these materials especially under high strain-rates of deformation. The aim of this work is to investigate the dynamic response of a polymer gel brain analog material under specific rotational-impact experiments. The selected polymer gel commercially known as Sylgard 527 has been studied using a specific procedure for its experimental characterization and numerical modeling. At first an indentation experiment was conducted at several loading rates to study the strain rate sensitivity of the Sylgard 527 gel. During the unloading several relaxation tests were performed after indentation, to assess the viscous behavior of the material. A specific numerical procedure based on moving least square approximation and response surface method was then performed to determine adequate robust material parameters of the Sylgard 527 gel. A sensitivity analysis was assessed to confirm the robustness of the obtained material parameters. For the validation of the obtained material model, a second experiment was conducted using a dynamic rotational loading apparatus. It consists of a metallic cylindrical cup filled with the polymer gel and subjected to an eccentric transient rotational impact. Complete kinematics of the cup and the large strains induced in the Sylgard 527 gel, have been recorded at several patterns by means of optical measurement. The whole apparatus was modeled by the Finite Element Method using explicit dynamic time integration available within Ls-dyna® software. Comparison between the physical and the numerical models of the Sylgard 527 gel behavior under rotational choc shows excellent agreements.', \"Strategic infarct locations for post-stroke cognitive impairment: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 12 acute ischaemic stroke cohorts. Background: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) occurs in approximately half of people in the first year after stroke. Infarct location is a potential determinant of PSCI, but a comprehensive map of strategic infarct locations predictive of PSCI is unavailable. We aimed to identify infarct locations most strongly predictive of PSCI after acute ischaemic stroke and use this information to develop a prediction model. Methods: In this large-scale multicohort lesion-symptom mapping study, we pooled and harmonised individual patient data from 12 cohorts through the Meta-analyses on Strategic Lesion Locations for Vascular Cognitive Impairment using Lesion-Symptom Mapping (Meta VCI Map) consortium. The identified cohorts (as of Jan 1, 2019) comprised patients with acute symptomatic infarcts on CT or MRI (with available infarct segmentations) and a cognitive assessment up to 15 months after acute ischaemic stroke onset. PSCI was defined as performance lower than the fifth percentile of local normative data, on at least one cognitive domain on a multidomain neuropsychological assessment or on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used to calculate voxel-wise odds ratios (ORs) for PSCI that were mapped onto a three-dimensional brain template to visualise PSCI risk per location. For the prediction model of PSCI risk, a location impact score on a 5-point scale was derived from the VLSM results on the basis of the mean voxel-wise coefficient (ln[OR]) within each patient's infarct. We did combined internal–external validation by leave-one-cohort-out cross-validation for all 12 cohorts using logistic regression. Predictive performance of a univariable model with only the location impact score was compared with a multivariable model with addition of other clinical PSCI predictors (age, sex, education, time interval between stroke onset and cognitive assessment, history of stroke, and total infarct volume). Testing of visual ratings was done by three clinicians, and accuracy, inter-rater reliability, and intra-rater reliability were assessed with Cohen's weighted kappa. Findings: In our sample of 2950 patients (mean age 66·8 years [SD 11·6]; 1157 [39·2%] women), 1286 (43·6%) had PSCI. We achieved high lesion coverage of the brain in our analyses (86·9%). Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, left thalamus, and right parietal lobe were strongly associated with PSCI (after false discovery rate correction, q<0·01; voxel-wise ORs >20). On cross-validation, the location impact score showed good correspondence, based on visual assessment of goodness of fit, between predicted and observed risk of PSCI across cohorts after adjusting for cohort-specific PSCI occurrence. Cross-validations showed that the location impact score by itself had similar performance to the combined model with other PSCI predictors, while allowing for easy visual assessment. Therefore the univariable model with only the location impact score was selected as the final model. Correspondence between visual ratings and actual location impact score (Cohen's weighted kappa: range 0·88–0·92), inter-rater agreement (0·85–0·87), and intra-rater agreement (for a single rater, 0·95) were all high. Interpretation: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive map of strategic infarct locations associated with risk of PSCI. A location impact score was derived from this map that robustly predicted PSCI across cohorts. Furthermore, we developed a quick and reliable visual rating scale that might in the future be applied by clinicians to identify individual patients at risk of PSCI.

Modafinil, a wake-promoting compound now used worldwide in sleep medicine, was initially regarded as a sedative compound because mice were so quiet with respect to locomotion after receiving it that this behavioral state was qualified as sedation. In the early 1980's when modafinil was first assessed by polysomnography in a cat in our laboratory, surprisingly, the cat spent the whole night awake without even one minute of sleep! This initial observation resulted subsequently in a series of basic and clinical studies in order to define the pharmacological profile of modafinil and its mode of action and, notably, to identify the brain targets by which modafinil acts to promote wakefulness. These studies were undertaken using pharmacologic approach coupled with the Cerveau isolé (brain transection) preparation, c-fos labelling and knockout mouse models. It was also in this context that we have developed a purified polyclonal antibody against modafinil. We expected that using immunohistochemistry with this antibody would allow us to localize the brain distribution of modafinil dosing. Surprisingly, we found discrete modafinil immunoreactive neuronal populations in several brain areas of modafinil-naive cats, rodents and humans. The most numerous and intensely labeled modafinil-immunoreactive neurons characterized by granular staining were found in the basal forebrain. They shared the regional location with cholinergic and aspartate-containing neurons but did not colocalize with them. In summary, we here present a newly identified neuronal population located in the basal forebrain that has never previously been published and suggests that these modafinil-immunoreactive neurons might be involved in forebrain functions such as sleep-wake control and cognition. This paper briefly reviews our journey with modafinil research and presents new unpublished experimental data.\", 'Stroke location is an independent predictor of cognitive outcome. Background and Purpose - On top of functional outcome, accurate prediction of cognitive outcome for stroke patients is an unmet need with major implications for clinical management. We investigated whether stroke location may contribute independent prognostic value to multifactorial predictive models of functional and cognitive outcomes. Methods - Four hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were prospectively assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at 24 to 72 hours and at 3 months for functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale and cognitive outcome using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical maps of functional and cognitive eloquent regions were derived from the first 215 patients (development sample) using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. We used multivariate logistic regression models to study the influence of stroke location (number of eloquent voxels from voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping maps), age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and stroke volume on modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. The second part of our cohort was used as an independent replication sample. Results - In univariate analyses, stroke location, age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume were all predictive of poor modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. In multivariable analyses, stroke location remained the strongest independent predictor of MoCA and significantly improved the prediction compared with using only age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume (area under the curve increased from 0.697-0.771; difference=0.073; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.155). In contrast, stroke location did not persist as independent predictor of modified Rankin Scale that was mainly driven by initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (area under the curve going from 0.840 to 0.835). Similar results were obtained in the replication sample. Conclusions - Stroke location is an independent predictor of cognitive outcome (MoCA) at 3 months post stroke.', 'Fluorescent sp<sup>3</sup> Defect-Tailored Carbon Nanotubes Enable NIR-II Single Particle Imaging in Live Brain Slices at Ultra-Low Excitation Doses. Cellular and tissue imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, ~1000–1350 nm) is advantageous for in vivo studies because of low light extinction by biological constituents at these wavelengths. However, deep tissue imaging at the single molecule sensitivity has not been achieved in the NIR-II window due to lack of suitable bio-probes. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have emerged as promising near-infrared luminescent molecular bio-probes; yet, their inefficient photoluminescence (quantum yield ~1%) drives requirements for sizeable excitation doses (~1–10 kW/cm2) that are significantly blue-shifted from the NIR-II region (<850 nm) and may thus ultimately compromise live tissue. Here, we show that single nanotube imaging can be achieved in live brain tissue using ultralow excitation doses (~0.1 kW/cm2), an order of magnitude lower than those currently used. To accomplish this, we synthesized fluorescent sp3-defect tailored (6,5) carbon nanotubes which, when excited at their first order excitonic transition\\xa0(~985 nm) fluoresce brightly at ~1160 nm. The biocompatibility of these functionalized nanotubes, which are wrapped by encapsulation agent (phospholipid-polyethylene glycol), is demonstrated using standard cytotoxicity assays. Single molecule photophysical studies of these biocompatible nanotubes allowed us to identify the optimal luminescence properties in the context of biological imaging.', 'Skin landmarks to main cerebral structures: how to identify the main cerebral sulci? An anatomical study. Purpose: Neuronavigation is used in neurosurgical practice to locate the cortical structures. If this tool is unavailable, basic anatomical knowledge should be used. Craniometry has been rarely detailed in recent literature, systematically using bony landmarks. The aim of this study is to describe skin landmarks for neurosurgical practice. Methods: Dissection of 10 hemispheres with insertion of radio-opaque markers within the limits of lateral sulcus, central and pre-central sulci, and preoccipital notch. Computed tomography was performed in all cases and multiplanar reconstructions were performed. Maximal intensity projection (MIP) fusion images were used for measurements between known skin landmarks and sulci of interests. Results: The Anterior Sylvian Point is measured 31.8 ± 2.8\\xa0mm behind the orbital wall, 36.9 ± 3\\xa0mm above the zygomatic arch. The horizontal part of the lateral sulcus is measured 59 ± 6\\xa0mm above the tragus. The Superior Rolandic Point is measured 190.7 ± 4.5\\xa0mm behind the nasion. The Pre-occipital Notch is measured 37.0 ± 6.9\\xa0mm above the tragus and 67.1 ± 6.4\\xa0mm behind. The Ideal Entry Points (IEP) for ventricular punctures are measured 120.2 ± 7\\xa0mm behind the nasion and 33.8 ± 3\\xa0mm laterally for the frontal IEP, and 61.3\\xa0mm ± 2.5\\xa0mm above and 64.7 ± 6.8\\xa0mm behind the tragus for the parieto-occipital IEP. Conclusion: In this study, we described simple skin landmarks for lateral sulcus, central sulcus, preoccipital notch, and an IEP for ventricular drainage. Precise knowledge of brain sulcal anatomy will guide patient’s positioning, skin incision, and craniotomies; and permits checking of imaging data provided by neuronavigation systems.', \"IL-17 triggers the onset of cognitive and synaptic deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related mouse models has been recognized for decades, but the contribution of the recently described meningeal immune population to AD pathogenesis remains to be addressed. Here, using the 3xTg-AD model, we report an accumulation of interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing cells, mostly γδ T cells, in the brain and the meninges of female, but not male, mice, concomitant with the onset of cognitive decline. Critically, IL-17 neutralization into the ventricles is sufficient to prevent short-term memory and synaptic plasticity deficits at early stages of disease. These effects precede blood-brain barrier disruption and amyloid-beta or tau pathology, implying an early involvement of IL-17 in AD pathology. When IL-17 is neutralized at later stages of disease, the onset of short-memory deficits and amyloidosis-related splenomegaly is delayed. Altogether, our data support the idea that cognition relies on a finely regulated balance of “inflammatory” cytokines derived from the meningeal immune system.\", 'Prediction of activation patterns preceding hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia using machine learning with structured sparsity. Despite significant progress in the field, the detection of fMRI signal changes during hallucinatory events remains difficult and time-consuming. This article first proposes a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify resting-state fMRI periods that precede hallucinations versus periods that do not. When applied to whole-brain fMRI data, state-of-the-art classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), yield dense solutions that are difficult to interpret. We proposed to extend the existing sparse classification methods by taking the spatial structure of brain images into account with structured sparsity using the total variation penalty. Based on this approach, we obtained reliable classifying performances associated with interpretable predictive patterns, composed of two clearly identifiable clusters in speech-related brain regions. The variation in transition-to-hallucination functional patterns not only from one patient to another but also from one occurrence to the next (e.g., also depending on the sensory modalities involved) appeared to be the major difficulty when developing effective classifiers. Consequently, second, this article aimed to characterize the variability within the prehallucination patterns using an extension of principal component analysis with spatial constraints. The principal components (PCs) and the associated basis patterns shed light on the intrinsic structures of the variability present in the dataset. Such results are promising in the scope of innovative fMRI-guided therapy for drug-resistant hallucinations, such as fMRI-based neurofeedback.', \"What are the Most Frequently Impaired Markers of Neurodegeneration in ADNI Subjects?. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau) and 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) hypometabolism in subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and specifically to determine which index of neurodegeneration was most frequently affected. The secondary objective was to determine the most frequently hypometabolic region in patients with a CSF AD signature (abnormal Aβ1-42 and abnormal p-tau). We included the 372 subjects (85 normal subjects, 212 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 75 patients with AD) with a CSF biomarker dosage (Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau) and brain FDG-PET. The relationship between FDG-PET metabolism (in five regions of interest (ROI) known to be damaged in AD) and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels was studied as a function of CSF Aβ1-42 status. FDG-PET hypometabolism and CSF t-tau and p-tau levels were correlated only in patients with an abnormal CSF Aβ1-42 level (t-tau: R2 = 0.044, p = 0.001; p-tau: R2 = 0.02, p = 0.03). In the latter patients, CSF p-tau was the most frequently (p = 0.0001) abnormal neurodegeneration marker (p-tau: 92.8%; FDG-PET: 56.5%; CSF t-tau: 59.1%). Within the five ROI of FDG PET, the angular gyrus metabolism (R2 = 0.149; p = 0.0001) was selected as the most tightly associated with CSF AD signature. The relation between CSF markers of neurodegeneration (p-tau and t-tau) and brain hypometabolism (in FDG-PET) is conditioned by presence of amyloid abnormality. This finding supports the current physiopathological model of AD. P-tau is the most frequently impaired biomarker. Using FDG PET angular gyrus hypometabolism is the most sensitive to CSF-biomarker-defined AD.\", 'Anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids in the brain: Physiological mechanisms and relevance to pharmacology. Classically, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were largely thought to be relatively inert structural components of brain, largely important for the formation of cellular membranes. Over the past 10 years, a host of bioactive lipid mediators that are enzymatically derived from arachidonic acid, the main n-6 PUFA, and docosahexaenoic acid, the main n-3 PUFAin the brain,knownto regulate peripheralimmune function, have been detected in the brain and shown to regulate microglia activation. Recent advances have focused on how PUFA regulate the molecular signaling of microglia, especially in the context of neuroinflammation and behavior. Several active drugs regulate brain lipid signaling and provide proof of concept for targeting the brain. Because brain lipid metabolism relies on a complex integration of diet, peripheral metabolism, including the liver and blood, which supply the brain with PUFAs that can be altered by genetics, sex, and aging, there are many pathways that can be disrupted, leading to altered brain lipid homeostasis. Brain lipid signaling pathways are altered in neurologic disorders and may be viable targets for the development of novel therapeutics. In this study, we discuss in particular how n-3 PUFAs and their metabolites regulate microglia phenotype and function to exert their antiinflammatory and proresolving activities in the brain.', \"CB 1 Receptor Signaling in the Brain: Extracting Specificity from Ubiquity. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are amongst the most ubiquitous signaling molecules in the nervous system. Over the past few decades, observations based on a large volume of work, first examining the pharmacological effects of exogenous cannabinoids, and then the physiological functions of eCBs, have directly challenged long-held and dogmatic views about communication, plasticity and behavior in the central nervous system (CNS). The eCBs and their cognate cannabinoid receptors exhibit a number of unique properties that distinguish them from the widely studied classical amino-acid transmitters, neuropeptides, and catecholamines. Although we now have a loose set of mechanistic rules based on experimental findings, new studies continue to reveal that our understanding of the eCB system (ECS) is continuously evolving and challenging long-held conventions. Here we will briefly summarize findings on the current canonical view of the 'ECS' and will address novel aspects that reveal how a nearly ubiquitous system can determine highly specific functions in the brain. In particular, we will focus on findings that push for an expansion of our ideas around long-held beliefs about eCB signaling that, while clearly true, may be contributing to an oversimplified perspective on how cannabinoid signaling at the microscopic level impacts behavior at the macroscopic level.\", 'The Neuro-Computational Architecture of Value-Based Selection in the Human Brain. Current neural models of value-based decision-making consider choices as a 2-stage process, proceeding from the \"valuation\" of each option under consideration to the \"selection\" of the best option on the basis of their subjective values. However, little is known about the computational mechanisms at play at the selection stage and its implementation in the human brain. Here, we used drift-diffusion models combined with model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, effective connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the neuro-computational architecture of value-based decisions. We found that 2 key drift-diffusion computations at the selection stage, namely integration and choice readout, engage distinct brain regions, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex integrating a decision value signal computed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal cortex reading out choice outcomes. Our findings suggest that this prefronto-parietal network acts as a hub implementing behavioral selection through a distributed drift-diffusion process.', 'Predictive value of brain MRI at term-equivalent age in extremely preterm children on neurodevelopmental outcome at school-age. This study’s objective was to correlate the abnormalities in brain MRIs performed at corrected-term age for minor or moderate neurocognitive disorders in children school-age born extremely premature (EPT) and without serious sequelae such as autism, cerebral palsy, mental impairment. Data were issued from a cross-sectional multicenter study (GP-Qol study, number NCT01675726). Clinical examination and psychometric assessments were performed when the children were between 7 and 10\\xa0years old during a day-long evaluation. Term-equivalent age brain MRIs on EPT were analyzed with a standardized scoring system. There were 114 children included in the study. The mean age at the time of evaluation, was 8.47\\xa0years old (± 0.70). 59% of children with at least one cognitive impairment and 53% who had a dysexecutive disorder. Only ten EPT (8.7%) presented moderate to severe white and grey matter abnormalities. These moderate to severe grey matter abnormalities were associated with at least two abnormal executive functions [OR 3.08 (95% CI 1.04–8.79), p = 0.04] and language delay [OR 3.25 (95% CI 1.03–9.80), p = 0.04]. These results remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Moderate to severe ventricular dilatation abnormalities (15%, n = 17) were associated with ideomotor dyspraxia [OR 7.49 (95% CI 1.48–35.95), p = 0.02] and remained significant in multivariate analysis [OR 11.2 (95% CI 1.45–131.4), p = 0.02]. Biparietal corrected diameters were moderate abnormal in 20% of cases (n = 23) and were associated to visuo spatial integration delay [OR 4.13 (95% CI 1.23–13.63), p = 0.02]. Cerebral MRI at term-equivalent age with scoring system analysis can provide information on long-term neuropsychological outcomes at school-age in EPTs children having no severe disability.', 'Human subcortical brain asymmetries in 15,847 people worldwide reveal effects of age and sex. The two hemispheres of the human brain differ functionally and structurally. Despite over a century of research, the extent to which brain asymmetry is influenced by sex, handedness, age, and genetic factors is still controversial. Here we present the largest ever analysis of subcortical brain asymmetries, in a harmonized multi-site study using meta-analysis methods. Volumetric asymmetry of seven subcortical structures was assessed in 15,847 MRI scans from 52 datasets worldwide. There were sex differences in the asymmetry of the globus pallidus and putamen. Heritability estimates, derived from 1170 subjects belonging to 71 extended pedigrees, revealed that additive genetic factors influenced the asymmetry of these two structures and that of the hippocampus and thalamus. Handedness had no detectable effect on subcortical asymmetries, even in this unprecedented sample size, but the asymmetry of the putamen varied with age. Genetic drivers of asymmetry in the hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia may affect variability in human cognition, including susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.', 'Action, observation or imitation of virtual hand movement affect differently regions of the mirror neuron system and the default mode network. Virtual reality (VR)-based paradigms use visual stimuli that can modulate visuo-motor networks leading to the stimulation of brain circuits. The aims of this study were to compare the changes in blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal when watching and imitating moving real (RH) and virtual hands (VH) in 11 healthy participants (HP). No differences were found between the observation of RH or VH making this VR-based experiment a promising tool for rehabilitation protocols. VH-imitation involved more the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) as part of the mirror neuron system (MNS) compared to execution and VH-observation conditions. The dorsal-anterior Precuneus (da-Pcu) as part of the Precuneus/posterior Cingulate Cortex (Pcu/pCC) complex, a key node of the Default Mode Network (DMN), was also less deactivated and therefore more involved. These results may reflect the dual visuo-motor roles for the vPMC and the implication of the da-Pcu in the reallocation of attentional and neural resources for bimodal task management. The ventral Pcu/pCC was deactivated regardless of the condition confirming its role in self-reference processes. Imitation of VH stimuli can then modulate the activation of specific areas including those belonging to the MNS and the DMN.', 'CT-Visible Convexity Subarachnoid Hemorrhage is Associated With Cortical Superficial Siderosis and Predicts Recurrent ICH. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether acute convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) detected on CT in lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with recurrent ICH. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of consecutive acute lobar ICH survivors fulfilling the Boston criteria for possible or probable CAA who had both brain CT and MRI at index ICH. Presence of cSAH was assessed on CT blinded to MRI data. Cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), cerebral microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities were evaluated on MRI. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between cSAH and the risk of recurrent symptomatic ICH during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 244 ICH survivors (76.4 ± 8.7 years; 54.5% female) were included. cSAH was observed on baseline CT in 99 patients (40.5%). Presence of cSAH was independently associated with cSS, hematoma volume, and preexisting dementia. During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 49 patients (20.0%) had recurrent symptomatic ICH. Presence of cSAH was associated with recurrent ICH (hazard ratio 2.64; 95% confidence interval 1.46-4.79; p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, antiplatelet use, warfarin use, and history of previous ICH. CONCLUSION: cSAH was detected on CT in 40.5% of patients with acute lobar ICH related to CAA and heralds an increased risk of recurrent ICH. This CT marker may be widely used to stratify the ICH risk in patients with CAA. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that cSAH accurately predicts recurrent stroke in patients with CAA.', 'Modeling [<sup>11</sup>C]yohimbine PET human brain kinetics with test-retest reliability, competition sensitivity studies and search for a suitable reference region. Previous work introduced the [11C]yohimbine as a suitable ligand of central α2-adrenoreceptors (α2-ARs) for PET imaging. However, reproducibility of [11C]yohimbine PET measurements in healthy humans estimated with a simplified modeling method with reference region, as well as sensitivity of [11C]yohimbine to noradrenergic competition were not evaluated. The objectives of the present study were therefore to fill this gap. Methods: Thirteen healthy humans underwent two [11C]yohimbine 90-minute dynamic scans performed on a PET-MRI scanner. Seven had arterial blood sampling with metabolite assessment and plasmatic yohimbine free fraction evaluation at the first scan to have arterial input function and test appropriate kinetic modeling. The second scan was a simple retest for 6 subjects to evaluate the test-retest reproducibility. For the remaining 7 subjects the second scan was a challenge study with the administration of a single oral dose of 150 µg of clonidine 90 min before the PET scan. Parametric images of α2-ARs distribution volume ratios (DVR) were generated with two non-invasive models: Logan graphical analysis with Reference (LREF) and Simplified Reference Tissue Method (SRTM). Three reference regions (cerebellum white matter (CERWM), frontal white matter (FLWM), and corpus callosum (CC)) were tested. Results: We showed high test-retest reproducibility of DVR estimation with LREF and SRTM regardless of reference region (CC, CERWM, FLWM). The best fit was obtained with SRTMCC (r2=0.94). Test-retest showed that the SRTMCC is highly reproducible (mean ICC>0.7), with a slight bias (-1.8%), whereas SRTMCERWM had lower bias (-0.1%), and excellent ICC (mean>0.8). Using SRTMCC, regional changes have been observed after clonidine administration with a significant increase reported in the amygdala and striatum as well as in several posterior cortical areas as revealed with the voxel-based analysis. Conclusion: The results add experimental support for the suitability of [11C]yohimbine PET in the quantitative assessment of α2-ARs occupancy in vivo in the human brain. Trial registration EudraCT 2018-000380-82', 'N-acetylcysteine inhibits bacterial lipopeptide-mediated neutrophil transmigration through the choroid plexus in the developing brain. The etiology of neurological impairments associated with prematurity and other perinatal complications often involves an infectious or pro-inflammatory component. The use of antioxidant molecules have proved useful to protect the neonatal brain from injury. The choroid plexuses-CSF system shapes the central nervous system response to inflammation at the adult stage, but little is known on the neuroimmune interactions that take place at the choroidal blood-CSF barrier during development. We previously described that peripheral administration to neonatal mice of the TLR2 ligand PAM3CSK4 (P3C), a prototypic Gram-positive bacterial lipopeptide, induces the migration of innate immune cells to the CSF. Here we showed in neonatal rats exposed to P3C that the migration of neutrophils into the CSF, which occurred through the choroid plexuses, is abolished following administration of the antioxidant drug N-acetylcysteine. Combining light sheet microscopy imaging of choroid plexus, a differentiated model of the blood-CSF barrier, and multiplex cytokine assays, we showed that the choroidal epithelium responds to the bacterial insult by a specific pattern of cytokine secretion, leading to a selective accumulation of neutrophils in the choroid plexus and to their trafficking into CSF. N-acetylcysteine acted by blocking neutrophil migration across both the endothelium of choroidal stromal vessels and the epithelium forming the blood-CSF barrier, without interfering with neutrophil blood count, neutrophil tropism for choroid plexus, and choroidal chemokine-driven chemotaxis. N-acetylcysteine reduced the injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia in P3C-sensitized neonatal rats. Overall, the data show that a double endothelial and epithelial check point controls the transchoroidal migration of neutrophils into the developing brain. They also point to the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in reducing the deleterious effects of inflammation-associated perinatal injuries by a previously undescribed mechanism, i.e. the inhibition of innate immune cell migration across the choroid plexuses, without interfering with the systemic inflammatory response to infection.', 'Parasomnia versus epilepsy: An affair of the heart?. Objective: Differential diagnosis between sleep-related epileptic seizures and NREM parasomnia remains challenging. Pathophysiological markers to differentiate both conditions are needed. Activation of autonomic system is present in arousal reactions and epileptic seizures. Our study investigated whether cardiac reactivity differed between arousal disorders and sleep-related seizures. Methods: Nocturnal recordings of 50 patients (10 in each group: frontal lobe epilepsy [FLE], temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE], nocturnal terror [NT], confusional arousal [CA], normal arousals [NA]) were retrospectively selected. Timing of the first motor sign and description of behaviours were assessed. Beat-to-beat RR intervals (RRI) as well as heart rate variability were analysed over a period of 60 heartbeats before and after first motor manifestation. The slope and area under the curve (AUC) of RRI were calculated. Results: A significant decrease in RRI was observed at the onset of all events. Statistical analysis revealed: lower RRI in TLE than in other groups; higher slope of RRI in FLE than in NA and TLE, and higher AUC in NT and FLE than in TLE, and in NT than in NA. Sleep stage, episode duration, vocalization characteristics, lateralized or abnormal posture, exploratory behaviour differed between epileptic and parasomnia groups. Discussion: Analysis of cardiac reactivity seems to be a useful objective tool, together with clinical features, for diagnosing abnormal behaviour during sleep. Cardiac reactivity in TLE could reflect epileptic discharge propagation to brain areas involved in autonomic control, while FLE and NT might involve a strong non-specific activation of the sympathetic system.', \"A likely placental barrier against methylmercury in pregnant rats exposed to fish-containing diets. Methylmercury (MeHg) taken up through fish consumption can be transferred from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy. In the present study, pregnant rat mothers were contaminated with environmentally relevant doses of 36 and 76 ng MeHg/g of food using diets containing naturally mercury-containing fish. Young female rats fed with fish-containing food after weaning showed decreased locomotion in Y maze for accumulated concentrations in brain as low as 75 ng Hg/g dry weight (15 ng Hg/g wet weight). Young female rats fed the control diet after weaning yet borne by mothers fed the diet containing 76 ng MeHg/g, presented a 58% reduced activity in the open-field labyrinth, meaning that the maternal exposure to fish-containing food exerted an effect in utero that lasted several weeks after birth. Newborns were protected against Hg exposure by the placental barrier since in newborns from mothers fed the diet containing 76 ng MeHg/g of food, the concentrations of Hg in brain, kidney, liver and skeletal muscles represented 12, 3, 21 and 18% of those of their mother's tissues, respectively. These results suggest the existence, at least in rats, of a threshold level in terms of MeHg exposure above which the placental barrier collapses.\", 'Self-propelling vesicles define glycolysis as the minimal energy machinery for neuronal transport. The glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) facilitates fast axonal transport in neurons. However, given that GAPDH does not produce ATP, it is unclear whether glycolysis per se is sufficient to propel vesicles. Although many proteins regulating transport have been identified, the molecular composition of transported vesicles in neurons has yet to be fully elucidated. Here we selectively enrich motile vesicles and perform quantitative proteomic analysis. In addition to the expected molecular motors and vesicular proteins, we find an enrichment of all the glycolytic enzymes. Using biochemical approaches and super-resolution microscopy, we observe that most glycolytic enzymes are selectively associated with vesicles and facilitate transport of vesicles in neurons. Finally, we provide evidence that mouse brain vesicles produce ATP from ADP and glucose, and display movement in a reconstituted in vitro transport assay of native vesicles. We conclude that transport of vesicles along microtubules can be autonomous.', \"Cyclosporine A, a Potential Therapy of Ischemic Reperfusion Injury. A Common History for Heart and Brain. Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) and acute myocardial infarction require emergency reperfusion tissue in order to improve functional outcome. Intra-arterial thrombectomy recently showed very encouraging improvement in IS patients' outcome. However, endovascular methods enhancing reperfusion may expose patients to increase in ischemic reperfusion injury. Experimental evidence indicates that brain ischemic reperfusion injury may be attenuated by ischemic pre- and postconditioning. The opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore plays a critical role in the onset of reperfusion damage. This mechanism can be inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine A (CsA). Summary: In this review, we present existing experimental and clinical data suggesting that conditioning interventions may prevent brain ischemic reperfusion injury and future challenge for neuroprotection by CsA in acute IS. Key Messages: The concept of conditioning has been recently investigated clinically but to a lesser extent in the realm of IS. Recent experimental and phase II clinical research has suggested potential neuroprotective properties of cyclosporine; however, further larger clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that CsA improves clinical outcome in acute IS patients.\", 'Aquaporins in brain edema. Brain edema is a common feature of brain injuries, which leads to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and ischemia that worsen outcome. Current management of edema focuses on reduction of ICP, but there are no treatments targeting the molecular players directly involved in edema process. The perivascular astrocyte endfeet are critical in maintaining brain homeostasis with ionic and water exchange; in this context, aquaporins (AQPs), astrocyte water channels, have emerged as privileged targets for edema modulation. However, AQPs can facilitate either accumulation or drainage of water, depending on the osmotic gradients between extra-intracellular space; and thus inhibition of AQPs leads to different outcomes depending on specific tissue characteristics and time post-injury. Most of this knowledge has been gathered from the study of AQP4, the best characterized AQP and the one that has the biggest impact on water movement. In addition to the level of expression, the ratio of AQP4 isoforms (m1, m23 or mz), the spatial distribution of AQP4 into orthogonal arrays of particles, and the interaction of AQP4 with neighboring ionic channels and gap junctions could directly impact edema formation. Although there are no specific AQP4 pharmacological blockers, the development of AQP4 siRNA offers a promising therapeutic tool. Given the complex dynamics of AQP4, therapies targeting AQP4 should carefully take into account the particular features of the injury (e.g., hemorrhagic vs. non-hemorrhagic) and different times after injury (e.g., phase of edema formation vs. resolution).', \"Association of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease: New Entity or Coincidence? A Case Series. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia have a strong clinical, genetic, and pathological connection but association of ALS with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is seldom reported. We report a series of 5 cases of AD associated with ALS. Our patients presented with cognitive deterioration with episodic memory impairment meeting criteria for AD. ALS occurred subsequently in all cases and its phenotype was not homogenous. Amyloid process was confirmed in four cases with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. One case underwent postmortem exam, demonstrating hallmarks lesions of both diseases. This series highlights that ALS-AD phenotype could be a specific underexplored entity.\", \"Guidelines (short version) of the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL) on pediatric cochlear implant indications. Objectives: The authors present the guidelines of the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery (Société française d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie de la face et du cou – SFORL) on the indications for cochlear implantation in children. Methods: A multidisciplinary work group was entrusted with a review of the scientific literature on the above topic. Guidelines were drawn up, based on the articles retrieved and the group members’ individual experience. They were then read over by an editorial group independent of the work group. The guidelines were graded as A, B, C or expert opinion, by decreasing level of evidence. Results: The SFORL recommends that children with bilateral severe/profound hearing loss be offered bilateral cochlear implantation, with surgery before 12 months of age. In sequential bilateral cochlear implantation in children with severe/profound hearing loss, it is recommended to reduce the interval between the two implants, preferably to less than 18 months. The SFORL recommends encouraging children with unilateral cochlear implants to wear contralateral hearing aids when residual hearing is present, and recommends assessing perception with hearing-in-noise tests. It is recommended that the surgical technique should try to preserve the residual functional structures of the inner ear as much as possible.\", \"Evidence for an imbalance between tau O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is linked to neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mounting evidence suggests that tau phosphorylation and O-N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) are mutually exclusive post-translational modifications. O-GlcNAcylation depends on 3-5% of intracellular glucose that enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. To our knowledge, the existence of an imbalance between tau phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation has not been reported in animal models of AD, as yet. Here, we used triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice at 12 months, an age at which hyperphosphorylated tau is already detected and associated with cognitive decline. In these mice, we showed that tau was hyperphosphorylated on both Ser396 and Thr205 in the hippocampus, and to a lower extent and exclusively on Thr205 in the frontal cortex. Tau O-GlcNAcylation, assessed in tau immunoprecipitates, was substantially reduced in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice, with no changes in the frontal cortex or in the cerebellum. No changes in the expression of the three major enzymes involved in O-GlcNAcylation, i.e., glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase, and O-GlcNAc hydrolase were found in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These data demonstrate that an imbalance between tau phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation exists in AD mice, and strengthens the hypothesis that O-GlcNAcylation might be targeted by disease modifying drugs in AD.\", \"Differences in cortical perfusion detected by arterial spin labeling in nonamnestic and amnestic subtypes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Objectives: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) begins before the age of 65 and is characterized by a faster clinical course and the frequency of nonamnestic symptoms compared to late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). However, the pathophysiological process of EOAD remains unclear. We expected that ASL may show widespread cortical hypoperfusion in EOAD compared to LOAD and in nonamnestic EOAD compared to amnestic EOAD. Methods: In this study, 26 EOAD patients (16 amnestic and 10 nonamnestic patients), 29 LOAD patients and 12 healthy controls underwent pseudo-continuous ASL and 3D FFE T1 sequences. Statistical comparisons between EOAD, LOAD and control groups were made after surface-based analysis of CBF maps in regressing out the cortical thickness. Results: ASL showed a more severe hypoperfusion in nonamnestic EOAD patients compared to amnestic EOAD ones, with mean CBF values (± std) of 26.9 (± 3.8) and 46.6 (± 24.1) mL/100 g/min respectively (P = 0.014), located in the bilateral temporo-parietal neocortex, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortices (PCC) and frontal lobes. Comparison between EOAD and LOAD patients showed a trend to hypoperfusion in the left parietal lobe, PCC and precuneus in EOAD (P < 0.001 uncorrected). Conclusions: Different patterns of hypoperfusion between nonamnestic and amnestic EOAD subtypes were identified, with a more severe and extensive hypoperfusion in nonamnestic patients. A trend towards more severe hypoperfusion was detected in EOAD compared to LOAD. Further studies are needed to validate ASL as a potential tool for the distinction of EOAD subtypes and the prediction of the time course of the disease.\", \"Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease: Mitochondria, alpha-synuclein and much more…. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, age-related, neurodegenerative disease whose pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we give an overview of the progress that has been made over the past four decades in our understanding of this disorder. We review the role of mitochondria, environmental toxicants, alpha-synuclein and neuroinflammation in the development of PD. We also discuss more recent data from genetics, which strongly support the endosomal-lysosomal pathways and mitophagy as being central to PD. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of the gut-brain axis as a modulator of PD progression. This article is intended to provide a comprehensive, general and practical review of PD pathogenesis for the general neurologist.\", 'Headaches during pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy is frequent and challenging. A secondary headache is diagnosed in one third of women, and most causes are vascular and infectious disorders. Anamnestic and clinical features must be investigated, and brain imaging is often required. Primary headaches are commonly modified during pregnancy. Migraine is mainly improved in this context, especially migraine without aura. Particular cautions about treatment must be applied, and non-pharmacological measures must be preferred. Tension-type headache and cluster headache seem to be less hormone-dependent.', 'Transfer and Transcriptomic Profiling in Liver and Brain of European Eels (Anguilla anguilla) After Diet-borne Exposure to Gold Nanoparticles. A nanometric revolution is underway, promising technical innovations in a wide range of applications and leading to a potential boost in environmental discharges. The propensity of nanoparticles (NPs) to be transferred throughout trophic chains and to generate toxicity was mainly assessed in primary consumers, whereas a lack of knowledge for higher trophic levels persists. The present study focused on a predatory fish, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) exposed to gold NPs (AuNPs; 10 nm, polyethylene glycol–coated) for 21 d at 3 concentration levels in food: 0 (NP0), 1 (NP1), and 10 (NP10) mg Au kg−1. Transfer was assessed by Au quantification in eel tissues, and transcriptomic responses in the liver and brain were revealed by a high-throughput RNA-sequencing approach. Eels fed at NP10 presented an erratic feeding behavior, whereas Au quantification only indicated transfer to intestine and kidney of NP1-exposed eels. Sequencing of RNA was performed in NP0 and NP1 eels. A total of 258 genes and 156 genes were significantly differentially transcribed in response to AuNP trophic exposure in the liver and brain, respectively. Enrichment analysis highlighted modifications in the immune system–related processes in the liver. In addition, results pointed out a shared response of both organs regarding 13 genes, most of them being involved in immune functions.

Brain lesions do not just disable but also disconnect brain areas, which once deprived of their input or output, can no longer subserve behaviour and cognition. The role of white matter connections has remained an open question for the past 250 years. Based on 1333 stroke lesions, here we reveal the human Disconnectome and demonstrate its relationship to the functional segregation of the human brain. Results indicate that functional territories are not only defined by white matter connections, but also by the highly stereotyped spatial distribution of brain disconnections. While the former has granted us the possibility to map 590 functions on the white matter of the whole brain, the latter compels a revision of the taxonomy of brain functions. Overall, our freely available Atlas of White Matter Function will enable improved clinical-neuroanatomical predictions for brain lesion studies and provide a platform for explorations in the domain of cognition.', 'High–Molecular-Weight Paired Helical Filaments from Alzheimer Brain Induces Seeding of Wild-Type Mouse Tau into an Argyrophilic 4R Tau Pathology in\\xa0Vivo. In Alzheimer disease, the development of tau pathology follows neuroanatomically connected pathways, suggesting that abnormal tau species might recruit normal tau by passage from cell to cell. Herein, we analyzed the effect of stereotaxic brain injection of human Alzheimer high-molecular-weight paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the dentate gyrus of wild-type and mutant tau THY-Tau22 mice. After 3 months of incubation, wild-type and THY-Tau22 mice developed an atrophy of the dentate gyrus and a tau pathology characterized by Gallyas and tau-positive grain-like inclusions into granule cells that extended in the hippocampal hilus and eventually away into the alveus, and the fimbria. Gallyas-positive neuropil threads and oligodendroglial coiled bodies were also observed. These tau inclusions were composed only of mouse tau, and were immunoreactive with antibodies to 4R tau, phosphotau, misfolded tau, ubiquitin, and p62. Although local hyperphosphorylation of tau was increased in the dentate gyrus in THY-Tau22 mice, the development of neurofibrillary tangles made of mutant human tau was not accelerated in the hippocampus, indicating that wild-type human PHFs were inefficient in seeding tau aggregates made of G272V/P301S mutant human tau. Our results indicate thus that injection of human wild-type Alzheimer PHF seeded aggregation of wild-type murine tau into an argyrophilic 4R tau pathology, and constitutes an interesting model independent of expression of a mutant tau protein.', 'The SARS-CoV-2 main protease M<sup>pro</sup> causes microvascular brain pathology by cleaving NEMO in brain endothelial cells. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can damage cerebral small vessels and cause neurological symptoms. Here we describe structural changes in cerebral small vessels of patients with COVID-19 and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the vascular pathology. In brains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals and animal models, we found an increased number of empty basement membrane tubes, so-called string vessels representing remnants of lost capillaries. We obtained evidence that brain endothelial cells are infected and that the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) cleaves NEMO, the essential modulator of nuclear factor-κB. By ablating NEMO, Mpro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and the occurrence of string vessels in mice. Deletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption of the blood–brain barrier due to NEMO ablation. Importantly, a pharmacological inhibitor of RIPK signaling prevented the Mpro-induced microvascular pathology. Our data suggest RIPK as a potential therapeutic target to treat the neuropathology of COVID-19.', 'Association of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness with Brain Alterations in the Visual and Limbic Networks in Elderly Adults without Dementia. Importance: The eye is a sensory organ that is easily accessible for imaging techniques, allowing the measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. The eye is part of the central nervous system, and its neurons may be susceptible to degeneration; therefore, changes in the RNFL thickness may reflect microstructural and volume alterations in the brain. Objective: To explore the association between the peripapillary RNFL thickness and brain alterations in the visual and limbic networks in elderly people without dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of the Three-City/Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition et Maladies Oculaires (Alienor) Study cohort (April 2009 to December 2010). The dates of analysis were July 2017 to August 2018. The setting was a population-based study in France. The brain volume analysis included 104 participants, and the diffusion tensor imaging analysis included 79 participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Global RNFL was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Brain volumes were assessed via T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by measurement of the global white and gray matter fractions and the hippocampal fraction. Brain microstructural alterations were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging at the level of the posterior thalamic radiations, the limbic system tracts (the fornix and cingulum bundles), and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (control region). Linear regression models adjusted for several confounders were performed. Results: Among a total of 104 participants, the mean (SD) age was 80.8 (3.9) years, and the cohort was 56.7% women (n = 59). The mean (SD) global RNFL thickness was 89.3 (12.9) µm. A thicker RNFL was associated with a greater hippocampal fraction (quantity of increase ß = 0.013; 95% CI, 0.001-0.025 per 10-µm increase in the RNFL thickness) and better diffusion tensor imaging variables in the global cingulum (mean diffusivity ß = -0.007; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.000) and the hippocampal part of the cingulum (mean diffusivity ß = -0.009; 95% CI, -0.016 to -0.002 and radial diffusivity ß = -0.010; 95% CI, -0.018 to -0.002) and the posterior thalamic radiations (fractional anisotropy ß = 0.008; 95% CI, 0.000-0.017). No significant associations were found with other magnetic resonance imaging volumes or with other diffusion tensor imaging variables. In particular, there was no significant association with the control region of interest. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that in elderly individuals without dementia, a thicker RNFL was associated with better magnetic resonance imaging variables both in a region that included the visual pathways and in regions particularly involved in the neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer disease..', 'Therapeutic implications of altered cholesterol homeostasis mediated by loss of CYP46A1 in human glioblastoma. Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is a hallmark of many cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM), but its role in disease progression is not well understood. Here, we identified cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), a brain-specific enzyme responsible for the elimination of cholesterol through the conversion of cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC), as one of the most dramatically dysregulated cholesterol metabolism genes in GBM. CYP46A1 was significantly decreased in GBM samples compared with normal brain tissue. A reduction in CYP46A1 expression was associated with increasing tumour grade and poor prognosis in human gliomas. Ectopic expression of CYP46A1 suppressed cell proliferation and in\\xa0vivo tumour growth by increasing 24OHC levels. RNA-seq revealed that treatment of GBM cells with 24OHC suppressed tumour growth through regulation of LXR and SREBP signalling. Efavirenz, an activator of CYP46A1 that is known to penetrate the blood–brain barrier, inhibited GBM growth in\\xa0vivo. Our findings demonstrate that CYP46A1 is a critical regulator of cellular cholesterol in GBM and that the CYP46A1/24OHC axis is a potential therapeutic target.', 'Brain tumor necrosis factor-α mediates anxiety-like behavior in a mouse model of severe obesity. Although the high prevalence of anxiety in obesity increasingly emerges as significant risk factor for related severe health complications, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Considering that chronic inflammation is a key component of obesity and is well known to impact brain function and emotional behavior, we hypothesized that it may similarly contribute to the development of obesity-related anxiety. This hypothesis was experimentally tested by measuring whether chronic food restriction, a procedure known to reduce inflammation, or chronic anti-inflammatory treatment with ibuprofen improved anxiety-like behavior and concomitantly decreased peripheral and/or hippocampal inflammation characterizing a model of severe obesity, the db/db mice. In both experiments, reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the open-field and/or elevated plus-maze were selectively associated with decreased hippocampal tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression. Highlighting the causality of both events, chronic central infusion of the TNF-α blocker etanercept was then shown to be sufficient to improve anxiety-like behavior in db/db mice. Lastly, by measuring the impact of ex-vivo etanercept on hippocampal synaptic processes underlying anxiety-like behaviors, we showed that the anxiolytic effect of central TNF-α blockade likely involved modulation of synaptic transmission within the ventral hippocampus. Altogether, these results uphold the role of brain TNF-α in mediating obesity-related anxiety and provide important clues about how it may modulate brain function and behavior. They may therefore help to introduce novel therapeutic strategies to reduce anxiety associated with inflammatory conditions.', 'Barriers to Drug Distribution into the Perinatal and Postnatal Brain. Drug bioavailability to the developing brain is a major concern in the treatment of neonates and infants as well as pregnant and breast-feeding women. Central adverse drug reactions can have dramatic consequences for brain development, leading to major neurological impairment. Factors setting the cerebral bioavailability of drugs include protein-unbound drug concentration in plasma, local cerebral blood flow, permeability across blood-brain interfaces, binding to neural cells, volume of cerebral fluid compartments, and cerebrospinal fluid secretion rate. Most of these factors change during development, which will affect cerebral drug concentrations. Regarding the impact of blood-brain interfaces, the blood-brain barrier located at the cerebral endothelium and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier located at the choroid plexus epithelium both display a tight phenotype early on in embryos. However, the developmental regulation of some multispecific efflux transporters that also limit the entry of numerous drugs into the brain through barrier cells is expected to favor drug penetration in the neonatal brain. Finally, drug cerebral bioavailability is likely to be affected following perinatal injuries that alter blood-brain interface properties. A thorough investigation of these mechanisms is mandatory for a better risk assessment of drug treatments in pregnant or breast-feeding women, and in neonate and pediatric patients.', 'Brain functional connectivity upon awakening from sleep predicts interindividual differences in dream recall frequency. Why do some individuals recall dreams every day while others hardly ever recall one? We hypothesized that sleep inertia - the transient period following awakening associated with brain and cognitive alterations - could be a key mechanism to explain interindividual differences in dream recall at awakening. To test this hypothesis, we measured the brain functional connectivity (combined electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging) and cognition (memory and mental calculation) of high dream recallers (HR, n = 20) and low dream recallers (LR, n = 18) in the minutes following awakening from an early-afternoon nap. Resting-state scans were acquired just after or before a 2 min mental calculation task, before the nap, 5 min after awakening from the nap, and 25 min after awakening. A comic was presented to the participants before the nap with no explicit instructions to memorize it. Dream(s) and comic recall were collected after the first post-awakening scan. As expected, between-group contrasts of the functional connectivity at 5 min post-awakening revealed a pattern of enhanced connectivity in HR within the default mode network (DMN) and between regions of the DMN and regions involved in memory processes. At the behavioral level, a between-group difference was observed in dream recall, but not comic recall. Our results provide the first evidence that brain functional connectivity right after awakening is associated with interindividual trait differences in dream recall and suggest that the brain connectivity of HR at awakening facilitates the maintenance of the short-term memory of the dream during the sleep-wake transition.', \"Cognitive control of orofacial motor and vocal responses in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial human frontal cortex. In the primate brain, a set of areas in the ventrolateral frontal (VLF) cortex and the dorsomedial frontal (DMF) cortex appear to control vocalizations. The basic role of this network in the human brain and how it may have evolved to enable complex speech remain unknown. In the present functional neuroimaging study of the human brain, a multidomain protocol was utilized to investigate the roles of the various areas that comprise the VLF-DMF network in learning rule-based cognitive selections between different types of motor actions: manual, orofacial, nonspeech vocal, and speech vocal actions. Ventrolateral area 44 (a key component of the Broca's language production region in the human brain) is involved in the cognitive selection of orofacial, as well as, speech and nonspeech vocal responses; and the midcingulate cortex is involved in the analysis of speech and nonspeech vocal feedback driving adaptation of these responses. By contrast, the cognitive selection of speech vocal information requires this former network and the additional recruitment of area 45 and the presupplementary motor area. We propose that the basic function expressed by the VLF-DMF network is to exert cognitive control of orofacial and vocal acts and, in the language dominant hemisphere of the human brain, has been adapted to serve higher speech function. These results pave the way to understand the potential changes that could have occurred in this network across primate evolution to enable speech production.\", \"Long-range temporal correlations in the brain distinguish conscious wakefulness from induced unconsciousness. Rhythmic neuronal synchronization across large-scale networks is thought to play a key role in the regulation of conscious states. Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15–30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8–13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.\", \"An Echo of Consciousness: Brain Function during Preferred Music. Background: Given its emotional and autobiographical properties, music appears as a potential aid in diagnostic assessment and therapeutics in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs). Several studies have shown boosting effects on behavior and brain functioning when patients were exposed to (their preferred) music. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if these effects on the brain's spontaneous activity are dependent on the level of consciousness. Methods: Nine postcomatose patients and eight healthy control subjects were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in two conditions: rest (without stimulation) and music. All patients presented at least an auditory startle, thereby suggesting the presence of residual auditory function. A gradient of consciousness (from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome to healthy subjects) was formulated to evaluate consciousness-level-dependent increases in brain activity and connectivity. Network-based functional connectivity assessed auditory, default-mode, frontoparietal, and music-evoked emotion networks. Furthermore, exploratory voxel-to-voxel analyses were performed at the whole brain level using intrinsic connectivity contrast and (fractional) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Results: Stronger consciousness-level-dependent increases within network-to-voxel analysis of connectivity were found in the frontoparietal network with the precuneus during music stimulation compared with rest. Voxel-to-voxel analyses showed stronger increases of intrinsic connectivity in the music condition compared with rest in regions previously related to music processing. There were consistently more regions with increased connectivity during the main effect of music compared with rest. These increases of connectivity during music were observed in brain regions involved in consciousness, language, emotion, and memory processing. Conclusions: Our results show that music seems to trigger more substantial connectivity changes compared with rest, pointing toward the potential ability of music to stimulate patients' brain function. Further research should focus on effects of music in general, its specific acoustical features, and the effects of simple auditory stimuli, as well as the possible therapeutic and diagnostic effects of music in well-controlled clinical trials. Due to its emotional and autobiographical properties, music is a particularly salient stimulus. A few studies using musical stimuli have shown promising results in terms of behavioral responsiveness in patients with disorders of consciousness (Magee, 2005; Raglio et al., 2014; Verger et al., 2014). Our study confirms the presence of a beneficial effect of music on brain connectivity in these severely brain-injured patients, which moreover seems to be dependent on the level of consciousness. Our findings therefore strengthen the hypothesis that music could play a role from a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint in this population, paving the way for future well-controlled clinical trials.\", 'Towards in vivo imaging of functionally active 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptors in schizophrenia: concepts and challenges. The serotonin 5-HT1A receptor has attracted wide attention as a target for treatment of psychiatric disorders. Although this receptor is important in the pharmacological mechanisms of action of new-generation antipsychotics, its characterization remains incomplete. Studies based on in vitro molecular imaging on brain tissue by autoradiography, and more recently in vivo PET imaging, have not yielded clear results, in particular due to the limitations of current 5-HT1A radiotracers, which lack specificity and/or bind to all 5-HT1A receptors, regardless of their functional status. The new concept of PET neuroimaging of functionally active G-protein-coupled receptors makes it possible to revisit PET brain exploration by enabling new research paradigms. For the 5-HT1A receptor it is now possible to use [18F]-F13640, a 5-HT1A receptor radioligand with high efficacy agonist properties, to specifically visualize and quantify functionally active receptors, and to relate this information to subjects’ pathophysiological or pharmacological state. We therefore propose imaging protocols to follow changes in the pattern of functional 5-HT1A receptors in relation to mood deficits or cognitive processes. This could allow improved discrimination of different schizophrenia phenotypes and greater understanding of the basis of therapeutic responses to antipsychotic drugs. Finally, as well as targeting functionally active receptors to gain insights into the role of 5-HT1A receptors, the concept can also be extended to the study of other receptors involved in the pathophysiology or therapy of psychiatric disorders.', \"Cerebral and extracerebral vulnerability to hypoxic insults after diffuse traumatic brain injury in rats. The post-traumatic brain vulnerability suggests that after traumatic brain injury (TBI), the brain may be more susceptible to posttraumatic hypoxic insults. This concept could be extended to 'peripheral' organs, as non-neurologic organ failure is common after TBI. This study aims to characterize and quantify cerebral and extracerebral tissue hypoxia with pimonidazole resulting from a standardized hypoxia-hypotension (HH) phase occurring after a diffuse experimental TBI in rats. Rats were allocated to Sham (n=5), TBI (n=7), HH (n=7) and TBI+HH (n=7) groups. Then, pimonidazole was injected and brain, liver, heart and kidneys were analysed. In the cerebral cortex, post-treatment hypoxia was higher in TBI+HH group than Sham group (p=0.003), HH group (p=0.003) and TBI group (p=0.002). Large trends in thalamus, hippocampus and striatum for the TBI+HH group compared to the other groups were observed. For the heart and liver, the 4 groups were comparable. For the kidneys, post-treatment hypoxia was higher in the TBI group compared to the Sham and HH groups, but not more than TBI+HH group. This study reveals that a posttraumatic hypoxic insult occurring after a severe TBI has major hypoxic consequences on brain structures. However, TBI by itself appears to induce renal hypoxia that is not enhanced by posttraumatic hypoxic insult.\", 'EEG ultradian rhythmicity differences in disorders of consciousness during wakefulness. Temporal fluctuations of cognitively-mediated behaviors in minimally conscious state (MCS) have been linked to changes of awareness, but the time-pattern of these variations remains ill-described. We analyzed 4-h EEG recordings from 12 patients with disorders of consciousness (6 MCS and 6 vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, VS/UWS). Relative powers (delta, theta, alpha, beta1 and beta2 bands) and spectral entropy were estimated (Fz, Cz and Pz derivations). Spectral entropy time-courses were then analyzed. MCS patients had higher theta and alpha and lower delta power when compared to VS/UWS. They showed higher spectral entropy mean value and higher time variability. MCS patients were characterized by spectral entropy fluctuations with periodicities of 70\\xa0min (range 57–80 min). Notably, these periodicities closely resemble those described in awake healthy subjects, which were hypothesized to be related to fluctuation in vigilance/attention. No significant periodicity was observed for VS/UWS. The spectral entropy periodicity found in MCS patients could reflect the fluctuation of awareness responsible for the inconsistency of MCS manifestation of cognitively-mediated behaviors. The presence of a 70\\xa0min periodicity in spectral entropy could permit clinicians to better choose their time-window when performing a clinical assessment of consciousness. It could also permit to monitor fluctuations in cognitive performance (i.e., response to command) during complementary testing by passive or active electrophysiological or functional neuroimaging paradigms or in resting state conditions.', 'Sleep architecture and homeostasis in mice with partial ablation of melanin-concentrating hormone neurons. Recent reports support a key role of tuberal hypothalamic neurons secreting melanin concentrating-hormone (MCH) in the promotion of Paradoxical Sleep (PS). Controversies remain concerning their concomitant involvement in Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS). We studied the effects of their selective loss achieved by an Ataxin 3-mediated ablation strategy to decipher the contribution of MCH neurons to SWS and/or PS. Polysomnographic recordings were performed on male adult transgenic mice expressing Ataxin-3 transgene within MCH neurons (MCHAtax) and their wild-type littermates (MCHWT) bred on two genetic backgrounds (FVB/N and C57BL/6). Compared to MCHWT mice, MCHAtax mice were characterized by a significant drop in MCH mRNAs (-70%), a partial loss of MCH-immunoreactive neurons (-30%) and a marked reduction in brain density of MCH-immunoreactive fibers. Under basal condition, such MCHAtax mice exhibited higher PS amounts during the light period and a pronounced SWS fragmentation without any modification of SWS quantities. Moreover, SWS and PS rebounds following 4-h total sleep deprivation were quantitatively similar in MCHAtax vs. MCHWT mice. Additionally, MCHAtax mice were unable to consolidate SWS and increase slow-wave activity (SWA) in response to this homeostatic challenge as observed in MCHWT littermates. Here, we show that the partial loss of MCH neurons is sufficient to disturb the fine-tuning of sleep. Our data provided new insights into their contribution to subtle process managing SWS quality and its efficiency rather than SWS quantities, as evidenced by the deleterious impact on two powerful markers of sleep depth, i.e., SWS consolidation/fragmentation and SWA intensity under basal condition and under high sleep pressure.', 'Brain energy rescue: an emerging therapeutic concept for neurodegenerative disorders of ageing. The brain requires a continuous supply of energy in the form of ATP, most of which is produced from glucose by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, complemented by aerobic glycolysis in the cytoplasm. When glucose levels are limited, ketone bodies generated in the liver and lactate derived from exercising skeletal muscle can also become important energy substrates for the brain. In neurodegenerative disorders of ageing, brain glucose metabolism deteriorates in a progressive, region-specific and disease-specific manner — a problem that is best characterized in Alzheimer disease, where it begins presymptomatically. This Review discusses the status and prospects of therapeutic strategies for countering neurodegenerative disorders of ageing by improving, preserving or rescuing brain energetics. The approaches described include restoring oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, increasing insulin sensitivity, correcting mitochondrial dysfunction, ketone-based interventions, acting via hormones that modulate cerebral energetics, RNA therapeutics and complementary multimodal lifestyle changes.', 'Relationships between brain perfusion and early recanalization after intravenous thrombolysis for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion. In large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, it is unclear whether severity of ischemia is involved in early post-thrombolysis recanalization over and above thrombus site and length. Here we assessed the relationships between perfusion parameters and early recanalization following intravenous thrombolysis administration in LVO patients. From a multicenter registry, we identified 218 thrombolysed LVO patients referred for thrombectomy with both (i) pre-thrombolysis MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2*-imaging, MR-angiography and dynamic susceptibility-contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI); and (ii) evaluation of recanalization on first angiographic run or non-invasive imaging ≤ 3 h from thrombolysis start. Infarct core volume on DWI, PWI-DWI mismatch volume and hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR; defined as Tmax ≥ 10 s volume/ Tmax ≥ 6 s volume, low HIR indicating milder hypoperfusion) were determined using a commercially available software. Early recanalization occurred in 34 (16%) patients, and multivariable analysis was associated with lower HIR (P = 0.006), shorter thrombus on T2*-imaging (P < 0.001) and more distal occlusion (P = 0.006). However, the relationship between HIR and early recanalization was robust only for thrombus length <14 mm. In summary, the present study disclosed an association between lower HIR and early post-thrombolysis recanalization. Early post-thrombolysis recanalization is therefore determined not only by thrombus site and length but also by severity of ischemia.', 'Brain reactivity to humorous films is affected by insomnia. Study objectives: Emotional reactivity to negative stimuli has been investigated in insomnia, but little is known about emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and its neural representation. Methods: We used 3 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine neural reactivity during the presentation of standardized short, 10-to 40-seconds, humorous films in patients with insomnia (n = 20, 18 females, aged 27.7 +/-8.6 years) and age-matched individuals without insomnia (n = 20, 19 females, aged 26.7 +/-7.0 years) and assessed humor ratings through a visual analog scale. Seed-based functional connectivity was analyzed for the left and right amygdalas (lAMYG and rAMYG, respectively) networks: group-level mixed-effects analysis (FLAME; FMRIB Software Library [FSL]) was used to compare amygdala connectivity maps between groups. Results: fMRI seed-based analysis of the amygdala revealed stronger neural reactivity in patients with insomnia than in controls in several brain network clusters within the reward brain network, without humor rating differences between groups (p = 0.6). For lAMYG connectivity, cluster maxima were in the left caudate (Z = 3.88), left putamen (Z = 3.79), and left anterior cingulate gyrus (Z = 4.11), whereas for rAMYG connectivity, cluster maxima were in the left caudate (Z = 4.05), right insula (Z = 3.83), and left anterior cingulate gyrus (Z = 4.29). Cluster maxima of the rAMYG network were correlated with hyperarousal scores in patients with insomnia only. Conclusions: The presentation of humorous films leads to increased brain activity in the neural reward network for patients with insomnia compared with controls, related to hyperarousal features in patients with insomnia, in the absence of humor rating group differences. These novel findings may benefit insomnia treatment interventions. Clinical trial: The Sleepless Brain: Neuroimaging Support for a Differential Diagnosis of Insomnia (SOMNET).

Mid-infrared (IR), Raman, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy methods, as well as mass spectrometry (MS), can be used for 3D chemical imaging. These techniques offer an invaluable opportunity to access chemical features of biological samples in a nonsupervised way. The global chemical information they provide enables the exploitation of a large array of chemical species or parameters, so-called 'spectromics’. Extracting chemical data from spectra is critical for the high-quality chemical analysis of biosamples. Furthermore, these are the only currently available techniques that can quantitatively analyze tissue content (e.g., molecular concentrations) and substructures (e.g., cells or blood vessels). The development of chemical-derived biological metadata appears to be a new way to exploit spectral information with machine learning algorithms. 3D chemical imaging is achieved by several spectromicroscopic methods. These provide a quantitative analysis of tissue content and substructures with a depth of information that no other histological technique can determine from the same sample. However, they are currently underexploited despite their potential. Standardization of spectral data acquisition and treatments is the next frontier in the development of 3D chemical imaging routines. This methodological effort is required to advance the development of reliable analytical tools for the biosciences and industry. Spectromics is emerging as a new trend for nonsupervised and automated data treatment from 3D spectrum matrices. It has the advantages of being able to use all the chemical information available from spectra and of interpretability, since spectral data can be converted into biological metadata.\", 'Maintenance and Representation of Mind Wandering during Resting-State fMRI. Major advances in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques in the last two decades have provided a tool to better understand the functional organization of the brain both in health and illness. Despite such developments, characterizing regulation and cerebral representation of mind wandering, which occurs unavoidably during resting-state fMRI scans and may induce variability of the acquired data, remains a work in progress. Here, we demonstrate that a decrease or decoupling in functional connectivity involving the caudate nucleus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex and other domain-specific regions was associated with more sustained mind wandering in particular thought domains during resting-state fMRI. Importantly, our findings suggest that temporal and between-subject variations in functional connectivity of above-mentioned regions might be linked with the continuity of mind wandering. Our study not only provides a preliminary framework for characterizing the maintenance and cerebral representation of different types of mind wandering, but also highlights the importance of taking mind wandering into consideration when studying brain organization with resting-state fMRI in the future.', \"Endosulfine-alpha inhibits membrane-induced α-synuclein aggregation and protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Neuropathological and genetic findings suggest that the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (aSyn) is involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy. Evidence suggests that the self-assembly of aSyn conformers bound to phospholipid membranes in an aggregation-prone state plays a key role in aSyn neurotoxicity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that protein binding partners of lipid-associated aSyn could inhibit the formation of toxic aSyn oligomers at membrane surfaces. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the protein endosulfine-alpha (ENSA), previously shown to interact selectively with membrane-bound aSyn, in terms of its effects on the membrane-induced aggregation and neurotoxicity of two familial aSyn mutants, A30P and G51D. We found that wild-type ENSA, but not the non-aSyn-binding S109E variant, interfered with membrane-induced aSyn self-assembly, aSyn-mediated vesicle disruption and aSyn neurotoxicity. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that ENSA was down-regulated in the brains of synucleinopathy patients versus non-diseased individuals. Collectively, these results suggest that ENSA can alleviate neurotoxic effects of membrane-bound aSyn via an apparent chaperone-like activity at the membrane surface, and a decrease in ENSA expression may contribute to aSyn neuropathology in synucleinopathy disorders. More generally, our findings suggest that promoting interactions between lipid-bound, amyloidogenic proteins and their binding partners is a viable strategy to alleviate cytotoxicity in a range of protein misfolding disorders.\", 'Hedonic sensitivity to natural rewards is affected by prenatal stress in a sex-dependent manner. Palatable food is a strong activator of the reward circuitry and may cause addictive behavior leading to eating disorders. How early life events and sex interact in shaping hedonic sensitivity to palatable food is largely unknown. We used prenatally restraint stressed (PRS) rats, which show abnormalities in the reward system and anxious/depressive-like behavior. Some of the hallmarks of PRS rats are known to be sex-dependent. We report that PRS enhanced and reduced milk chocolate-induced conditioned place preference in males and females, respectively. Male PRS rats also show increases in plasma dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and reductions in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the NAc and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In male rats, systemic treatment with the DHT-lowering drug finasteride reduced both milk chocolate preference and NAc DA levels. Female PRS rats showed lower plasma estradiol (E2) levels and lower DA levels in the NAc, and 5-HT levels in the NAc and PFC. E2 supplementation reversed the reduction in milk chocolate preference and PFC 5-HT levels. In the hypothalamus, PRS increased ERα and ERβ estrogen receptor and CARTP (cocaine-and-amphetamine receptor transcript peptide) mRNA levels in males, and 5-HT2C receptor mRNA levels in females. Changes were corrected by treatments with finasteride and E2, respectively. These new findings show that early life stress has a profound impact on hedonic sensitivity to high-palatable food via long-lasting changes in gonadal hormones. This paves the way to the development of hormonal strategies aimed at correcting abnormalities in the response to natural rewards.', \"Primary fatty amides in plasma associated with brain amyloid burden, hippocampal volume, and memory in the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease biomarker discovery cohort. Introduction: A critical and as-yet unmet need in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the discovery of peripheral small molecule biomarkers. Given that brain pathology precedes clinical symptom onset, we set out to test whether metabolites in blood associated with pathology as indexed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers. Methods: This study analyzed 593 plasma samples selected from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, of individuals who were cognitively healthy (n = 242), had mild cognitive impairment (n = 236), or had AD-type dementia (n = 115). Logistic regressions were carried out between plasma metabolites (n = 883) and CSF markers, magnetic resonance imaging, cognition, and clinical diagnosis. Results: Eight metabolites were associated with amyloid β and one with t-tau in CSF, these were primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs), lipokines, and amino acids. From these, PFAMs, glutamate, and aspartate also associated with hippocampal volume and memory. Discussion: PFAMs have been found increased and associated with amyloid β burden in CSF and clinical measures.\", 'Multimodal Imaging with NanoGd Reveals Spatiotemporal Features of Neuroinflammation after Experimental Stroke. The purpose of this study is to propose and validate a preclinical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool to monitor neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke, based on injection of a novel multimodal nanoprobe, NanoGd, specifically designed for internalization by phagocytic cells. First, it is verified that NanoGd is efficiently internalized by microglia in vitro. In vivo MRI coupled with intravenous injection of NanoGd in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model results in hypointense signals in the ischemic lesion. In these mice, longitudinal two-photon intravital microscopy shows NanoGd internalization by activated CX3CR1-GFP/+ cells. Ex vivo analysis, including phase contrast imaging with synchrotron X-ray, histochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy corroborate NanoGd accumulation within the ischemic lesion and uptake by immune phagocytic cells. Taken together, these results confirm the potential of NanoGd-enhanced MRI as an imaging biomarker of neuroinflammation at the subacute stage of ischemic stroke. As far as it is known, this work is the first to decipher the working mechanism of MR signals induced by a nanoparticle passively targeted at phagocytic cells by performing intravital microscopy back-to-back with MRI. Furthermore, using a gadolinium-based rather than an iron-based contrast agent raises future perspectives for the development of molecular imaging with emerging computed tomography technologies.', 'Stereo-electro-encephalography−Guided Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation: From In\\xa0Vitro and In\\xa0Vivo Data to Technical Guidelines. Background Deep brain electrodes have been used for the past 10 years to produce bipolar stereo-electro-encephalography−guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG RF-TC). However, this technique is based on empiric knowledge. The aim of this study is 3-fold: 1) provide in\\xa0vivo animal data concerning the effect of bipolar RF-TC on brain and its safety; 2) assess the parameters of this procedure (current delivery and dipole selection) that produce the most efficient lesion; and 3) provide technical guidelines. Methods First we achieved in\\xa0vivo RF-TC on rabbit brains with several conditions (power delivered and lesioning duration) and analyzed their influence on the lesion produced. Only a difference in terms of volume was found, and type of histologic lesions was similar whatever the settings were. We then performed multiple RF-TC in\\xa0vitro on egg albumen, first with several parameters of radiofrequency and then with different dipole spatial selections. The end point was the size of the radiofrequency thermolesion produced. Results Using unfixed parameters of radiofrequency current delivery and increasing it until the power delivered by the generator collapsed produced significantly larger lesions (P\\xa0= 0.008) than other conditions. Concerning the dipole selection, the use of contiguous contacts on electrodes led to lesions with a higher volume (P\\xa0= 7.7\\xa0× 10−13) than those produced with noncontiguous ones. Conclusion Besides the target selection in SEEG RF-TC, which is summarized on the basis of a literature review, we report the optimal parameters: Radiofrequency current must be increased until the power delivered collapses, and dipoles should be constituted by contiguous electrode contacts.', 'Enhancing Plasticity of the Central Nervous System: Drugs, Stem Cell Therapy, and Neuro-Implants. Stroke represents the first cause of adult acquired disability. Spontaneous recovery, dependent on endogenous neurogenesis, allows for limited recovery in 50% of patients who remain functionally dependent despite physiotherapy. Here, we propose a review of novel drug therapies with strong potential in the clinic. We will also discuss new avenues of stem cell therapy in patients with a cerebral lesion. A promising future for the development of efficient drugs to enhance functional recovery after stroke seems evident. These drugs will have to prove their efficacy also in severely affected patients. The efficacy of stem cell engraftment has been demonstrated but will have to prove its potential in restoring tissue function for the massive brain lesions that are most debilitating. New answers may lay in biomaterials, a steadily growing field. Biomaterials should ideally resemble lesioned brain structures in architecture and must be proven to increase functional reconnections within host tissue before clinical testing.', 'Representational content of oscillatory brain activity during object recognition: Contrasting cortical and deep neural network hierarchies. Numerous theories propose a key role for brain oscillations in visual perception. Most of these theories postu-late that sensory information is encoded in specific oscillatory components (e.g., power or phase) of specific frequency bands. These theories are often tested with whole-brain recording methods of low spatial resolution (EEG or MEG), or depth recordings that provide a local, incomplete view of the brain. Opportunities to bridge the gap between local neural populations and whole-brain signals are rare. Here, using representational similarity analysis (RSA) in human participants we explore which MEG oscillatory components (power and phase, across various frequency bands) correspond to low or high-level visual object representations, using brain representations from fMRI, or layer-wise representations in seven recent deep neural networks (DNNs), as a tem-plate for low/high-level object representations. The results showed that around stimulus onset and offset, most transient oscillatory signals correlated with low-level brain patterns (V1). During stimulus presentation, sustained β (~20 Hz) and γ (>60 Hz) power best correlated with V1, while oscillatory phase components correlated with IT representations. Surprisingly, this pattern of results did not always correspond to low-level or high-level DNN layer activity. In particular, sustained β band oscillatory power reflected high-level DNN layers, suggestive of a feed-back component. These results begin to bridge the gap between whole-brain oscillatory signals and object representations supported by local neuronal activations.', 'Common and rare variant association analyses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identify 15 risk loci with distinct genetic architectures and neuron-specific biology. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime risk of one in 350 people and an unmet need for disease-modifying therapies. We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.', 'Deciphering human motion to discriminate social interactions: A developmental neuroimaging study. Non-verbal communication plays a major role in social interaction understanding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the development of the neural networks involved in social interaction recognition based on human motion in children (8-11), adolescents (13-17), and adults (20-41). Participants watched point-light videos depicting two actors interacting or moving independently and were asked whether these agents were interacting or not. All groups successfully performed the discrimination task, but children had a lower performance and longer response times than the older groups. In all three groups, the posterior parts of the superior temporal sulci and middle temporal gyri, the inferior frontal gyri and the anterior temporal lobes showed greater activation when observing social interactions. In addition, adolescents and adults recruited the caudate nucleus and some frontal regions that are part of the mirror system. Adults showed greater activations in parietal and frontal regions (part of them belonging to the social brain) than adolescents. An increased number of regions that are part of themirror systemnetwork or the social brain, as well as the caudate nucleus, were recruited with age. In conclusion, a shared set of brain regions enabling the discrimination of social interactions from neutralmovements through humanmotion is already present in 8-year-old children. Developmental processes such as refinements in the social brain andmirror systemwould help grasping subtle cues in non-verbal aspects of social interactions.', 'Integration of individual and social information for decision-making in groups of different sizes. When making judgments in a group, individuals often revise their initial beliefs about the best judgment to make given what others believe. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, we know little about how the brain updates beliefs when integrating personal judgments (individual information) with those of others (social information). Here, we investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms of how we adapt our judgments to those made by groups of different sizes, in the context of jury decisions for a criminal. By testing different theoretical models, we showed that a social Bayesian inference model captured changes in judgments better than 2 other models. Our results showed that participants updated their beliefs by appropriately weighting individual and social sources of information according to their respective credibility. When investigating 2 fundamental computations of Bayesian inference, belief updates and credibility estimates of social information, we found that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) computed the level of belief updates, while the bilateral frontopolar cortex (FPC) was more engaged in individuals who assigned a greater credibility to the judgments of a larger group. Moreover, increased functional connectivity between these 2 brain regions reflected a greater influence of group size on the relative credibility of social information. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the computational roles of the FPC-dACC network in steering judgment adaptation to a group’s opinion. Taken together, these findings provide a computational account of how the human brain integrates individual and social information for decision-making in groups.', 'Neuroplasticity and brain reorganization associated with positive outcomes of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in progressive multiple sclerosis: A fMRI study. Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a range of symptoms, including motor, sensorimotor and cognitive impairments, that limit the quality of life. A multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach in people affected by multiple sclerosis was recently reported to improve the functional abilities of MS patients in daily activities. The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on the whole brain of MS patients by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Thirty individuals affected by MS (49.9 ± 12.1 years; disease duration: 16.0 ± 8.5 years) with a medium-high severity of disease were enrolled. The fMRI examination assessed a range of action-related tasks involving passive movement, mental simulation of action and miming of action triggered by external stimuli, such as object photography. The three tasks were performed using each arm separately. The fMRI acquisitions were performed at T1 (inclusion in the study), T2 (3 months later, at the start of rehabilitation) and T3 (after 3 months of multidisciplinary rehabilitation). Results: The fMRI results revealed a significant reduction in the activity of brain areas related to task-specific networks as well as the activation of cerebral regions not usually involved in task-specific related network, such as the medial prefrontal area. Conclusions: The effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on activity and participation has been established in previous studies. Our study sheds new light on the effect of such treatment on brain reorganization.', 'Modular slowing of resting-state dynamic functional connectivity as a marker of cognitive dysfunction induced by sleep deprivation. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) in the resting state (rs) is considered as a correlate of cognitive processing. Describing dFC as a flow across morphing connectivity configurations, our notion of dFC speed quantifies the rate at which FC networks evolve in time. Here we probe the hypothesis that variations of rs dFC speed and cognitive performance are selectively interrelated within specific functional subnetworks. In particular, we focus on Sleep Deprivation (SD) as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. We found that whole-brain level (global) dFC speed significantly slows down after 24h of SD. However, the reduction in global dFC speed does not correlate with variations of cognitive performance in individual tasks, which are subtle and highly heterogeneous. On the contrary, we found strong correlations between performance variations in individual tasks –including Rapid Visual Processing (RVP, assessing sustained visual attention)– and dFC speed quantified at the level of functional sub-networks of interest. Providing a compromise between classic static FC (no time) and global dFC (no space), modular dFC speed analyses allow quantifying a different speed of dFC reconfiguration independently for sub-networks overseeing different tasks. Importantly, we found that RVP performance robustly correlates with the modular dFC speed of a characteristic frontoparietal module.', 'Neuroanatomical correlates of haptic object processing: combined evidence from tractography and functional neuroimaging. Touch delivers a wealth of information already from birth, helping infants to acquire knowledge about a variety of important object properties using their hands. Despite the fact that we are touch experts as much as we are visual experts, surprisingly, little is known how our perceptual ability in touch is linked to either functional or structural aspects of the brain. The present study, therefore, investigates and identifies neuroanatomical correlates of haptic perceptual performance using a novel, multi-modal approach. For this, participants’ performance in a difficult shape categorization task was first measured in the haptic domain. Using a multi-modal functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging analysis pipeline, functionally defined and anatomically constrained white-matter pathways were extracted and their microstructural characteristics correlated with individual variability in haptic categorization performance. Controlling for the effects of age, total intracranial volume and head movements in the regression model, haptic performance was found to correlate significantly with higher axial diffusivity in functionally defined superior longitudinal fasciculus (fSLF) linking frontal and parietal areas. These results were further localized in specific sub-parts of fSLF. Using additional data from a second group of participants, who first learned the categories in the visual domain and then transferred to the haptic domain, haptic performance correlates were obtained in the functionally defined inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Our results implicate SLF linking frontal and parietal areas as an important white-matter track in processing touch-specific information during object processing, whereas ILF relays visually learned information during haptic processing. Taken together, the present results chart for the first time potential neuroanatomical correlates and interactions of touch-related object processing.', 'The anterior midcingulate cortex might be a neuronal substrate for the ideomotor mechanism. The way the brain controls voluntary movements for normal and pathological subject remains puzzling. In this selective review, we provide unreported harmonies between the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) activities and the ideomotor mechanism postulating that voluntary movements are controlled by the anticipation of the expected perceptual consequences of an action, critically involving bidirectional interplay of a given motor activity and corresponding sensory feedback. Among other evidence, we found that the required asymmetry in the bidirectional interplay between a given motor command and its expected sensory effect could rely on the specific activity of aMCC neurons when observing errors and successes. We confirm this hypothesis by presenting a pathological perspective, studying obsessive–compulsive and other related disorders in which hyperactivated and uniform aMCC activities should lead to a circular-reflex process that results in persistent ideas and repeated actions. By evaluating normal and pathological data, we propose considering the aMCC at a central position within the cerebral network involved in the ideomotor mechanism.', \"Tau deletion promotes brain insulin resistance. The molecular pathways underlying tau pathology-induced synaptic/cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration are poorly understood. One prevalent hypothesis is that hyperphosphorylation, misfolding, and fibrillization of tau impair synaptic plasticity and cause degeneration. However, tau pathology may also result in the loss of specific physiological tau functions, which are largely unknown but could contribute to neuronal dysfunction. In the present study, we uncovered a novel function of tau in its ability to regulate brain insulin signaling. We found that tau deletion leads to an impaired hippocampal response to insulin, caused by altered IRS-1 and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10) activities. Our data also demonstrate that tau knockout mice exhibit an impaired hypothalamic anorexigenic effect of insulin that is associated with energy metabolism alterations. Consistently, we found that tau haplotypes are associated with glycemic traits in humans. The present data have far-reaching clinical implications and raise the hypothesis that pathophysiological tau loss-of-function favors brain insulin resistance, which is instrumental for cognitive and metabolic impairments in Alzheimer's disease patients.\", 'Brain-scale cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the delta-theta band is a robust signature of conscious states: an intracranial and scalp EEG study. Long-range cortico-cortical functional connectivity has long been theorized to be necessary for conscious states. In the present work, we estimate long-range cortical connectivity in a series of intracranial and scalp EEG recordings experiments. In the two first experiments intracranial-EEG (iEEG) was recorded during four distinct states within the same individuals: conscious wakefulness (CW), rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), stable periods of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and deep propofol anaesthesia (PA). We estimated functional connectivity using the following two methods: weighted Symbolic-Mutual-Information (wSMI) and phase-locked value (PLV). Our results showed that long-range functional connectivity in the delta-theta frequency band specifically discriminated CW and REM from SWS and PA. In the third experiment, we generalized this original finding on a large cohort of brain-injured patients. FC in the delta-theta band was significantly higher in patients being in a minimally conscious state (MCS) than in those being in a vegetative state (or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). Taken together the present results suggest that FC of cortical activity in this slow frequency band is a new and robust signature of conscious states.', 'Editorial: Brain-Targeted Autoimmunity: Beyond Multiple Sclerosis. ', 'Dietary omega-3 deficiency exacerbates inflammation and reveals spatial memory deficits in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide during gestation. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a common environmental insult on the developing brain and represents a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal models of in utero inflammation further revealed a causal link between maternal inflammatory activation during pregnancy and behavioural impairment relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. Accumulating evidence point out that proinflammatory cytokines produced both in the maternal and fetal compartments are responsible for social, cognitive and emotional behavioral deficits in the offspring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids with potent immunomodulatory activities. PUFAs and their bioactive derivatives can promote or inhibit many aspects of the immune and inflammatory response. PUFAs of the n-3 series (‘n-3 PUFAs’ also known as omega-3) exhibit anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution properties and promote immune functions, while PUFAs of the n-6 series (‘n-6 PUFAs’ or omega-6) favor pro-inflammatory responses. The present study aimed at providing insight into the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the consequences of MIA on brain development. We hypothesized that a reduction in n-3 PUFAs exacerbates both maternal and fetal inflammatory responses to MIA and later-life defects in memory in the offspring. Based on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of MIA (LPS injection at embryonic day 17), we showed that n-3 PUFA deficiency 1) alters fatty acid composition of the fetal and adult offspring brain; 2) exacerbates maternal and fetal inflammatory processes with no significant alteration of microglia phenotype, and 3) induces spatial memory deficits in the adult offspring. We also showed a strong negative correlation between brain content in n-3 PUFA and cytokine production in MIA-exposed fetuses. Overall, our study is the first to address the deleterious effects of n-3 PUFA deficiency on brain lipid composition, inflammation and memory performances in MIA-exposed animals and indicates that it should be considered as a potent environmental risk factor for the apparition of neurodevelopmental disorders.', 'Early to Long-Term Alterations of CNS Barriers After Traumatic Brain Injury: Considerations for Drug Development. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability, particularly amongst the young and the elderly. The functions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) are strongly impaired after TBI, thus affecting brain homeostasis. Following the primary mechanical injury that characterizes TBI, a secondary injury develops over time, including events such as edema formation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and alterations in paracelullar and transcellular transport. To date, most therapeutic interventions for TBI have aimed at direct neuroprotection during the acute phase and have not been successful. Targeting the barriers of the central nervous system (CNS) could be a wider therapeutic approach, given that restoration of brain homeostasis would benefit all brain cells, including neurons. Importantly, BBB disregulation has been observed even years after TBI, concomitantly with neurological and psychosocial sequelae; however, treatments targeting the post-acute phase are scarce. Here, we review the mechanisms of primary and secondary injury of CNS barriers, the accumulating evidence showing long-term damage to these structures and some of the therapies that have targeted these mechanisms. Finally, we discuss how the injury characteristics (hemorrhagic vs non-hemorrhagic, involvement of head rotation, gray vs white matter), the sex, and the age of the patient need to be carefully considered to improve clinical trial design and outcome interpretation, and to improve future drug development.', 'Acute ischaemic lesions are associated with cortical superficial siderosis in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Background and purpose: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) commonly detects acute ischaemic lesions in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), especially with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We investigated the relationship between cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), a neuroimaging marker of CAA, and DWI lesions in patients with acute ICH. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients with acute supratentorial ICH who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging within 10\\xa0days after symptom onset. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed for DWI lesions, cSS and other markers for small-vessel disease. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between cSS and DWI lesions. Results: Among 246 ICH survivors (mean age 71.4\\xa0±\\xa012.6\\xa0years) who were enrolled, 126 had lobar ICH and 120 had deep ICH. Overall, DWI lesions were observed in 38 (15.4%) patients and were more common in patients with lobar ICH than deep ICH (22.2% vs. 8.3%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.003). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the extent of white matter hyperintensities [odds ratio (OR), 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05–1.58; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02] and cSS severity (focal cSS: OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.28–9.84; disseminated cSS: OR, 4.41; 95% CI, 1.78–10.97; P\\xa0=\\xa00.001) were independently associated with the presence of DWI lesions. Conclusions: Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions are more frequently observed in patients with acute lobar ICH than in those with deep ICH. cSS severity and white matter hyperintensity extent are independent predictors for the presence of DWI lesions, suggesting that CAA may be involved in the pathogenesis of DWI lesions associated with acute ICH.', 'IL-7 immunotherapy for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient with already controlled HIV-1 infection on antiretroviral therapy.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a versatile molecule that plays key roles in the development and survival of mammalian species by endowing brain neuronal networks with the ability to make continual adjustments to function in response to moment-to-moment changes in physiological input. Here, we summarize the progress in the field and argue that NO-synthetizing neurons and NO signalling in the brain provide a core hub for integrating sensory- and homeostatic-related cues, control key bodily functions, and provide a potential target for new therapeutic opportunities against several neuroendocrine and behavioural abnormalities.', \"It's in the eye of the beholder: visual lateralisation in response to the social environment in poeciliids. The social environment offers fish complex information about the quality, performance, personality and other cues of potential mates and competitors simultaneously. It is likely, therefore, that the environmental information regarding the context of mate choice is perceived and processed differently in species and sexes in respect to lateralisation. The present study comparatively assessed visual lateralisation behaviour in response to different social or sexual stimuli in three closely related poeciliid species (P. latipinna, P. mexicana, P. formosa) in comparison to a more distantly related species (P. reticulata). Individuals were presented with four different social or sexual stimuli that were tested against a control stimulus; (a) a conspecific male, (b) a conspecific female, (c) a heterosexual conspecific pair, (d) three conspecific females (shoal). In order to approach a target stimulus, focal fish had to perform detours to the right or left of a vertically straight-shaped barrier. The three closely related poeciliid species, P. latipinna, P. mexicana, P. formosa, appeared to have a general tendency to turn right (i.e., left-eye preference), whereas the more distantly related P. reticulata males and females showed an overall bias to the left (i.e., right-eye preference) in response to various social–sexual incitements. Moreover, body size seemed to significantly influence especially the males’ detour behaviour, with smaller males acting in opposition to their larger conspecifics in response to certain social stimuli. In this case, smaller and larger Poecilia spp. males responded in the same way as smaller and larger males of the other three poeciliid species. Therefore, results possibly point to differences in the degree of general social behaviour between closely and more distantly related species and mating motivation amongst larger and smaller individuals when placed in a novel social environment. Hence, present results possibly suggest a sex-specific functional lateralisation for the analysis of visual information and seem to support the closer ancestral relationships between the Poecilia spp. tested in this study and the more distantly related guppies in terms of their left–right lateralisation. Generally, present results suggest that functional asymmetries in behaviour could be widespread among vertebrates, thus supporting the hypothesis of an early evolution of lateralisation in brain and behaviour.\", 'Weakness of the left hand and pallor in a 21-year-old woman.

Multi-modal neuroimaging projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank are advancing our understanding of human brain architecture, function, connectivity, and their variability across individuals using high-quality non-invasive data from many subjects. Such efforts depend upon the accuracy of non-invasive brain imaging measures. However, ‘ground truth’ validation of connectivity using invasive tracers is not feasible in humans. Studies using nonhuman primates (NHPs) enable comparisons between invasive and non-invasive measures, including exploration of how “functional connectivity” from fMRI and “tractographic connectivity” from diffusion MRI compare with long-distance connections measured using tract tracing. Our NonHuman Primate Neuroimaging & Neuroanatomy Project (NHP_NNP) is an international effort (6 laboratories in 5 countries) to: (i) acquire and analyze high-quality multi-modal brain imaging data of macaque and marmoset monkeys using protocols and methods adapted from the HCP; (ii) acquire quantitative invasive tract-tracing data for cortical and subcortical projections to cortical areas; and (iii) map the distributions of different brain cell types with immunocytochemical stains to better define brain areal boundaries. We are acquiring high-resolution structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data together with behavioral measures from over 100 individual macaques and marmosets in order to generate non-invasive measures of brain architecture such as myelin and cortical thickness maps, as well as functional and diffusion tractography-based connectomes. We are using classical and next-generation anatomical tracers to generate quantitative connectivity maps based on brain-wide counting of labeled cortical and subcortical neurons, providing ground truth measures of connectivity. Advanced statistical modeling techniques address the consistency of both kinds of data across individuals, allowing comparison of tracer-based and non-invasive MRI-based connectivity measures. We aim to develop improved cortical and subcortical areal atlases by combining histological and imaging methods. Finally, we are collecting genetic and sociality-associated behavioral data in all animals in an effort to understand how genetic variation shapes the connectome and behavior.', 'Mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics in neurodegeneration and neuronal plasticity. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continually move, fuse and divide. The dynamic balance of fusion and fission of mitochondria determines their morphology and allows their immediate adaptation to energetic needs, keeps mitochondria in good health by restoring or removing damaged organelles or precipitates cells in apoptosis in cases of severe defects. Mitochondrial fusion and fission are essential in mammals and their disturbances are associated with several diseases. However, while mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics, and the proteins that control these processes, are ubiquitous, associated diseases are primarily neurological disorders. Accordingly, inactivation of the main actors of mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics is associated with defects in neuronal development, plasticity and functioning, both ex vivo and in vivo. Here,we present the central actors of mitochondrial fusion and fission and reviewthe role of mitochondrial dynamics in neuronal physiology and pathophysiology. Particularemphasis is placed on the threemain actors of these processes i.e. DRP1,MFN1-2, and OPA1 aswell as on GDAP1, a protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane preferentially expressed in neurons. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria & Brain.', 'Variation in homotopic areas’ activity and inter-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity with type of language lateralization: an FMRI study of covert sentence generation in 297 healthy volunteers. We investigated the regional correlates of differences in hemispheric lateralization in 297 healthy volunteers [including 153 left-handers (LH)] previously classified into three types of language lateralization according to their hemispheric functional lateralization index measured with fMRI during covert sentence production versus word list production (PRODSENT-LIST): 250 leftward asymmetrical Typicals, 10 rightward asymmetrical Strong-atypicals (only LH), and 37 Ambilaterals with weak lateralization. Using a functionally driven homotopic atlas (AICHA), we compared patterns of regional asymmetry during PRODSENT-LIST in these three groups. Among the 192 homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) of the AICHA atlas, 58 exhibited a significant effect of the type of lateralization on their BOLD signal variation during PRODSENT-LIST. The analyses of patterns of asymmetry of these 58 hROIs showed that (1) hROIs asymmetries in Strong-atypicals were significantly negatively correlated with those observed in Typicals, which indicates that their regional pattern of rightward asymmetries was comparable to the regional pattern of leftward language asymmetries of Typicals; (2) right- and left-handed Typicals had identical profiles, whereas left-handed Ambilaterals exhibited reduced leftward asymmetry as compared either\\xa0to right-handed Ambilaterals or to Typicals. Moreover, left-handed Ambilaterals pattern of hROIs asymmetries significantly positively correlated with those of both Typicals and Strong-atypicals. In 291 of the participants, we tested the hypothesis that differences in language lateralization were associated with differences in inter-hemispheric connectivity during resting state by measuring their regional homotopic inter-hemispheric intrinsic connectivity coefficient (rHIICC) in 36 of the 58 hROIs known to be connected via the corpus callosum. Mean rHIICCs were negatively correlated with task-induced functional asymmetries, suggesting that enhanced inter-hemispheric cooperation at rest translates into increased inter-hemispheric cooperation during language production. In addition, the left-handed Ambilaterals exhibited a significantly larger rHIICC compared with right-handed Ambilaterals and Typicals, confirming a difference in inter-hemispheric organization in this group', 'Brain processing of a configural vs elemental odor mixture in the newborn rabbit. Organisms are surrounded throughout life by chemically complex odors. How individuals process an odorant within a mixture or a mixture as a whole is a key question in neuroethology and chemical senses. This question is addressed here by using newborn rabbits, which can be rapidly conditioned to a new stimulus by single association with the mammary pheromone. After conditioning to ethyl maltol (odorant B), pups behaviorally respond to B and an A′B′ mixture (68/32 ratio) but not to ethyl isobutyrate (odorant A) or an AB mixture (30/70 ratio). This suggests elemental and configural perception of A′B′ and AB, respectively. We then explored the neural substrates underlying the processing of these mixtures with the hypothesis that processing varies according to perception. Pups were pseudoconditioned or conditioned to B on postnatal day 3 before exposure to B, A′B′ or AB on day 4. Fos expression was not similar between groups (mainly in the olfactory bulb and posterior piriform cortex) suggesting a differential processing of the stimuli that might reflect either stimulus complexity or conditioning effect. Thus, the ratio of components in A′B′ vs AB leads to differential activation of the olfactory system which may contribute to elemental and configural percepts of these mixtures. In addition, together with recent behavioral data, this highlights that configural perception occurs even in relatively immature animals, emphasizing the value of the newborn rabbit for exploration of odor mixture processing from molecules to brain and behavior.', 'An optimized LC-HRMS untargeted metabolomics workflow for multi-matrices investigations in the three-spined stickleback. Environmental metabolomics has become a growing research field to understand biological and biochemical perturbations of organisms in response to various abiotic or biotic stresses. It focuses on the comprehensive and systematic analysis of a biologic system’s metabolome. This allows the recognition of biochemical pathways impacted by a stressor, and the identification of some metabolites as biomarkers of potential perturbations occurring in a body. In this work, we describe the development and optimization of a complete reliable methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for untargeted metabolomics studies within a fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We evaluated the differences and also the complementarities between four different matrices (brain, gills, liver and whole fish) to obtain metabolome information. To this end, we optimized and compared sample preparation and the analytical method, since the type and number of metabolites detected in any matrix are closely related to these latter. For the sample preparation, a solid-liquid extraction was performed on a low quantity of whole fish, liver, brain, or gills tissues using combinations of methanol/water/heptane. Based on the numbers of features observed in LC-HRMS and on the responses of analytical standards representative of different metabolites groups (amino acids, sugars. . .), we discuss the influence of the nature, volume, and ratio of extraction solvents, the sample weight, and the reconstitution solvent. Moreover, the analytical conditions (LC columns, pH and additive of mobile phases and ionization modes) were also optimized so as to ensure the maximum metabolome coverages. Thus, two complementary chromatographic procedures were combined in order to cover a broader range of metabolites: a reversed phase separation (RPLC) on a C18 column followed by detection with positive ionization mode (ESI+) and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) on a zwitterionic column followed by detection with negative ionization mode (ESI-). This work provides information on brain, gills, liver, vs the whole body contribution to the stickleback metabolome. These information would help to guide ecotoxicological and biomonitoring studies.', 'Dissemination in time and space in presymptomatic granulin mutation carriers: a GENFI spatial chronnectome study. The presymptomatic brain changes of granulin (GRN) disease, preceding by years frontotemporal dementia, has not been fully characterized. New approaches focus on the spatial chronnectome can capture both spatial network configurations and their dynamic changes over time. To investigate the spatial dynamics in 141 presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 282 noncarriers from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia research Initiative cohort. We considered time-varying patterns of the default mode network, the language network, and the salience network, each summarized into 4 distinct recurring spatial configurations. Dwell time (DT) (the time each individual spends in each spatial state of each network), fractional occupacy (FO) (the total percentage of time spent by each individual in a state of a specific network) and total transition number (the total number of transitions performed by each individual in a specifict state) were considered. Correlations between DT, FO, and transition number and estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) and clinical performances were assessed. Presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers spent significantly more time in those spatial states characterised by greater activation of the insula and the parietal cortices, as compared to noncarriers (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). A significant correlation between DT and FO of these spatial states and EYO was found, the longer the time spent in the spatial states, the closer the EYO. DT and FO significantly correlated with performances at tests tapping processing speed, with worse scores associated with increased spatial states’ DT. Our results demonstrated that presymptomatic GRN disease presents a complex dynamic reorganization of brain connectivity. Change in both the spatial and temporal aspects of brain network connectivity could provide a unique glimpse into brain function and potentially allowing a more sophisticated evaluation of the earliest disease changes and the understanding of possible mechanisms in GRN disease.', 'Development of handedness, anatomical and functional brain lateralization. The present chapter offers a report on the recent literature on the neural bases of hemispheric specialization (HS), anatomical and functional developmental timecourse of HS, and on the available knowledge of their relationships with the development of handedness. Strong anatomical asymmetries can be seen located along the end of the sylvian fissure and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) as soon as the 23rd gestational week. They correspond to a leftward sulcal depth asymmetry of the Sylvian fissure coupled with a rightward asymmetry of STS. These neonatal asymmetries targeting speech processing areas do not further change with development. Different from these anatomical asymmetries, the functional asymmetries of language areas develop during childhood. Such a development is characterized at birth by a predominant interhemispheric intrinsic connectivity between homotopic areas that will evolve toward left hemisphere intrahemispheric intrinsic connectivity between anterior and posterior language poles. The development of such a typical architecture of language networks in the left hemisphere dominant for language in more than 90% of humans translates into a continuous increase in the leftward asymmetries of activation during language production throughout childhood. With regard to the rightward cerebral lateralization for visuospatial functions, neuroimaging studies tend to indicate an increase in rightward lateralization of frontal–parietal network with age during visuospatial memory and visuospatial search tasks. In addition, the spatial–attentional behavioral asymmetries emerge early (in preschool children) and, then, can be modulated by factors linked to motor asymmetry and handedness. Finally, the study of manual lateralization in relation to language development has shown the importance of considering several characteristics of manual activities. In particular, the dissociation between manipulative activities and communicative gestures in young children may open further perspectives for future research on HS.', 'Near-infrared nanoscopy with carbon-based nanoparticles for the exploration of the brain extracellular space. Understanding the physiology and pathology of the brain requires detailed knowledge of its complex structures as well as dynamic internal processes at very different scales from the macro down to the molecular dimensions. A major yet poorly described brain compartment is the brain extracellular space (ECS). Signalling molecules rapidly diffuse through the brain ECS which is complex and dynamic structure at numerous lengths and time scales. In recent years, characterization of the ECS using nanomaterials has made remarkable progress, including local analysis of nanoscopic dimensions and diffusivity as well as local chemical sensing. In particular, carbon nanomaterials combined with advanced optical technologies, biochemical and biophysical analysis, offer novel promises for understanding the ECS morphology as well as neuron connectivity and neurochemistry. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art in this quest, which mainly focuses on a type of carbon nanomaterial, single walled carbon nanotubes, as fluorescent nanoprobes to unveil the ECS features in the nanometre domain.', \"Super-resolution shadow imaging reveals local remodeling of astrocytic microstructures and brain extracellular space after osmotic challenge. The extracellular space (ECS) plays a central role in brain physiology, shaping the time course and spread of neurochemicals, ions, and nutrients that ensure proper brain homeostasis and neuronal communication. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glia cell in the brain, whose processes densely infiltrate the brain's parenchyma. As astrocytes are highly sensitive to changes in osmotic pressure, they are capable of exerting a potent physiological influence on the ECS. However, little is known about the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the ECS that surrounds astrocytes, owing mostly to a lack of appropriate techniques to visualize the ECS in live brain tissue. Mitigating this technical limitation, we applied the recent SUper-resolution SHadow Imaging technique (SUSHI) to astrocyte-labeled organotypic hippocampal brain slices, which allowed us to concurrently image the complex morphology of astrocytes and the ECS with unprecedented spatial resolution in a live experimental setting. Focusing on ring-like astrocytic microstructures in the spongiform domain, we found them to enclose sizable pools of interstitial fluid and cellular structures like dendritic spines. Upon experimental osmotic challenge, these microstructures remodeled and swelled up at the expense of the pools, effectively increasing the physical interface between astrocytic and cellular structures. Our study reveals novel facets of the dynamic microanatomical relationships between astrocytes, neuropil, and the ECS in living brain tissue, which could be of functional relevance for neuron–glia communication in a variety of (patho)physiological settings, for example, LTP induction, epileptic seizures or acute ischemic stroke, where osmotic disturbances are known to occur.\", \"Common genetic signatures of Alzheimer's disease in Down Syndrome. Background: People with Down Syndrome (DS) are born with an extra copy of Chromosome (Chr) 21 and many of these individuals develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) when they age. This is due at least in part to the extra copy of the APP gene located on Chr 21. By 40 years, most people with DS have amyloid plaques which disrupt brain cell function and increase their risk for AD. About half of the people with DS develop AD and the associated dementia around 50 to 60 years of age, which is about the age at which the hereditary form of AD, early onset AD, manifests. In the absence of Chr 21 trisomy, duplication of APP alone is a cause of early onset Alzheimer's disease, making it likely that having three copies of APP is important in the development of AD and in DS. In individuals with both DS and AD, early behavior and cognition-related symptoms may include a reduction in social behavior, decreased enthusiasm, diminished ability to pay attention, sadness, fearfulness or anxiety, irritability, uncooperativeness or aggression, seizures that begin in adulthood, and changes in coordination and walking. Methods: We investigate the relationship between AD and DS through integrative analysis of genesets derived from a MeSH query of AD and DS associated beta amyloid peptides, Chr 21, GWAS identified AD risk factor genes, and differentially expressed genes in DS individuals. Results: Unique and shared aspects of each geneset were evaluated based on functional enrichment analysis, transcription factor profile and network analyses. Genes that may be important to both disorders: ACSM1, APBA2, APLP1, BACE2, BCL2L, COL18A1, DYRK1A, IK, KLK6, METTL2B, MTOR, NFE2L2, NFKB1, PRSS1, QTRT1, RCAN1, RUNX1, SAP18 SOD1, SYNJ1, S100B. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation/immune system processes likely underlie the pathogenesis of AD and DS.\", 'Enriched dairy fat matrix diet prevents early life lipopolysaccharide-induced spatial memory impairment at adulthood. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids, which are critical for brain development and later life cognitive functions. The main brain PUFAs are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for the n-3 family and arachidonic acid (ARA) for the n-6 family, which are provided to the post-natal brain by breast milk or infant formula. Recently, the use of dairy lipids (DL) in replacement of vegetable lipids (VL) was revealed to potently promote the accretion of DHA in the developing brain. Brain DHA, in addition to be a key component of brain development, display potent anti-inflammatory activities, which protect the brain from adverse inflammatory events. In this work, we evaluated the protective effect of partial replacement of VL by DL, supplemented or not with DHA and ARA, on post-natal inflammation and its consequence on memory. Mice were fed with diets poor in vegetal n-3 PUFA (Def VL), balanced in vegetal n-3/n-6 PUFA (Bal VL), balanced in dairy lipids (Bal DL) or enriched in DHA and ARA (Supp VL; Supp DL) from the first day of gestation until adulthood. At post-natal day 14 (PND14), pups received a single administration of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and brain cytokine expression, microglia phenotype and neurogenesis were measured. In a second set of experiments, memory and neurogenesis were measured at adulthood. Overall, our data showed that lipid quality of the diet modulates early life LPS effect on microglia phenotype, brain cytokine expression and neurogenesis at PND14 and memory at adulthood. In particular, Bal DL diet protects from the adverse effect of early life LPS exposure on PND14 neurogenesis and adult spatial memory.', 'Closed-Loop Systems and In Vitro Neuronal Cultures: Overview and Applications. One of the main limitations preventing the realization of a successful dialogue between the brain and a putative enabling device is the intricacy of brain signals. In this perspective, closed-loop in vitro systems can be used to investigate the interactions between a network of neurons and an external system, such as an interacting environment or an artificial device. In this chapter, we provide an overview of closed-loop in vitro systems, which have been developed for investigating potential neuroprosthetic applications. In particular, we first explore how to modify or set a target dynamical behavior in a network of neurons. We then analyze the behavior of in vitro systems connected to artificial devices, such as robots. Finally, we provide an overview of biological neuronal networks interacting with artificial neuronal networks, a configuration currently offering a promising solution for clinical applications.', 'The Relation between Alpha/Beta Oscillations and the Encoding of Sentence induced Contextual Information. Pre-stimulus alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (16–20 Hz) oscillations have been frequently linked to the prediction of upcoming sensory input. Do these frequency bands serve as a neural marker of linguistic prediction as well? We hypothesized that if pre-stimulus alpha and beta oscillations index language predictions, their power should monotonically relate to the degree of predictability of incoming words based on past context. We expected that the more predictable the last word of a sentence, the stronger the alpha and beta power modulation. To test this, we measured neural responses with magnetoencephalography of healthy individuals during exposure to a set of linguistically matched sentences featuring three levels of sentence context constraint (high, medium and low constraint). We observed fluctuations in alpha and beta power before last word onset, and modulations in M400 amplitude after last word onset. The M400 amplitude was monotonically related to the degree of context constraint, with a high constraining context resulting in the strongest amplitude decrease. In contrast, pre-stimulus alpha and beta power decreased more strongly for intermediate constraints, followed by high and low constraints. Therefore, unlike the M400, pre-stimulus alpha and beta dynamics were not indexing the degree of word predictability from sentence context.', 'High beta rhythm amplitude in olfactory learning signs a well-consolidated and non-flexible behavioral state. Beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) is a major candidate underlying long-range communication in the brain. In olfactory tasks, beta activity is strongly modulated by learning but its condition of expression and the network(s) responsible for its generation are unclear. Here we analyzed the emergence of beta activity in local field potentials recorded from olfactory, sensorimotor and limbic structures of rats performing an olfactory task. Rats performed successively simple discrimination, rule transfer, memory recall tests and contingency reversal. Beta rhythm amplitude progressively increased over learning in most recorded areas. Beta amplitude reduced to baseline when new odors were introduced, but remained high during memory recall. Intra-session analysis showed that even expert rats required several trials to reach a good performance level, with beta rhythm amplitude increasing in parallel. Notably, at the beginning of the reversal task, beta amplitude remained high while performance was low and, in all tested animals, beta amplitude decreased before rats were able to learn the new contingencies. Connectivity analysis showed that beta activity was highly coherent between all structures where it was expressed. Overall, our results suggest that beta rhythm is expressed in a highly coherent network when context learning - including both odors and reward - is consolidated and signals behavioral inflexibility.', 'Defining the phenotype of FHF1 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fibroblast growth-factor homologous factor (FHF1) gene variants have recently been associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). FHF1 encodes a cytosolic protein that modulates neuronal sodium channel gating. We aim to refine the electroclinical phenotypic spectrum of patients with pathogenic FHF1 variants. We retrospectively collected clinical, genetic, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging data of 17 patients with FHF1-DEE. Sixteen patients had recurrent heterozygous FHF1 missense variants: 14 had the recurrent p.Arg114His variant and two had a novel likely pathogenic variant p.Gly112Ser. The p.Arg114His variant is associated with an earlier onset and more severe phenotype. One patient carried a chromosomal microduplication involving FHF1. Twelve patients carried a de novo variant, five (29.5%) inherited from parents with gonadic or somatic mosaicism. Seizure onset was between 1\\xa0day and 41\\xa0months; in 76.5% it was within 30\\xa0days. Tonic seizures were the most frequent seizure type. Twelve patients (70.6%) had drug-resistant epilepsy, 14 (82.3%) intellectual disability, and 11 (64.7%) behavioral disturbances. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy in nine patients (52.9%). Overall, our findings expand and refine the clinical, EEG, and imaging phenotype of patients with FHF1-DEE, which is characterized by early onset epilepsy with tonic seizures, associated with moderate to severe ID and psychiatric features.', 'Midfrontal theta phase coordinates behaviorally relevant brain computations during cognitive control. Neural oscillations are thought to provide a cyclic time frame for orchestrating brain computations. Following this assumption, midfrontal theta oscillations have recently been proposed to temporally organize brain computations during conflict processing. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we show that brain-behavior relationships during conflict tasks are modulated according to the phase of ongoing endogenous midfrontal theta oscillations recorded by scalp EEG. We found reproducible results in two independent datasets, using two different conflict tasks: brain-behavior relationships (correlation between reaction time and theta power) were theta phase-dependent in a subject-specific manner, and these “behaviorally optimal” theta phases were also associated with fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present regardless of the strength of conflict. Thus, these results provide empirical evidence that midfrontal theta oscillations are involved in cyclically orchestrating brain computations likely related to response execution during the tasks rather than purely related to conflict processing. More generally, this study supports the hypothesis that phase-based computation is an important mechanism giving rise to cognitive processing.', 'Transmission of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies is associated with cognitive impairments in a primate. Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology transmission has been described in patients following iatrogenic exposure to compounds contaminated with Aβ proteins. It can induce cerebral Aβ angiopathy resulting in brain hemorrhages and devastating clinical impacts. Iatrogenic transmission of tau pathology is also suspected but not experimentally proven. In both scenarios, lesions were detected several decades after the putatively triggering medico-surgical act. There is however little information regarding the cognitive repercussions in individuals who do not develop cerebral hemorrhages. In the current study, we inoculated the posterior cingulate cortex and underlying corpus callosum of young adult primates (Microcebus murinus) with either Alzheimer’s disease or control brain extracts. This led to widespread Aβ and tau pathologies in all of the Alzheimer-inoculated animals following a 21-month-long incubation period (n = 12) whereas none of the control brain extract-inoculated animals developed such lesions (n = 6). Aβ deposition affected almost all cortical regions. Tau pathology was also detected in Aβ-deposit-free regions distant from the inoculation sites (e.g. in the entorhinal cortex), while some regions adjacent, but not connected, to the inoculation sites were spared (e.g. the occipital cortex). Alzheimer-inoculated animals developed cognitive deficits and cerebral atrophy compared to controls. These pathologies were induced using two different batches of Alzheimer brain extracts. This is the first experimental demonstration that tau can be transmitted by human brain extracts inoculations in a primate. We also showed for the first time that the transmission of widespread Aβ and tau pathologies can be associated with cognitive decline. Our results thus reinforce the need to organize a systematic monitoring of individuals who underwent procedures associated with a risk of Aβ and tau iatrogenic transmission. They also provide support for Alzheimer brain-inoculated primates as relevant models of Alzheimer pathology.', 'Stereotactic irradiation of non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases: evaluation of local and cerebral control in a large series. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of brain metastases (BM) results are often reported in the heterogeneous primitive population. Here, we report our experience in consecutively treated patients who underwent SRT alone for BM from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This retrospective analysis included consecutive patients with no history of cerebral treatment who underwent Cyberknife™ SRT for BM from NSCLC in our institution from 2007 to 2016. One hundred patients were included in the study, with a median follow-up of 33\\xa0months (20–64). Mean age was 63\\xa0years (SD ± 10); 88% had Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > 70; 67% had unique BM; 18 patients received single-fraction SRT (20–25\\xa0Gy), and 82 received hypo-fractionated SRT (HSRT) (24–36\\xa0Gy in 3–5 fractions). We reported a complication rate of 17% (2% of G3-4). Median survival was 10.1\\xa0months [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8–13.9]. At 1\\xa0year, local and cerebral control rates were respectively 78.7% (95% CI 70–86.5%) and 43% (95% CI 33.5–53%). Thirty patients underwent salvage treatment (whole brain radiation therapy, n = 13; SRT, n = 14; surgery, n = 3). Cyberknife™-based SRT is an effective treatment associated with high local control rate with low morbidity for patients with NSCLC’s BM. Close follow-up is necessary to perform salvage treatment.', 'Finding genetically-supported drug targets for Parkinson’s disease using Mendelian randomization of the druggable genome. Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that currently has no disease-modifying treatment, partly owing to inefficiencies in drug target identification and validation. We use Mendelian randomization to investigate over 3,000 genes that encode druggable proteins and predict their efficacy as drug targets for Parkinson’s disease. We use expression and protein quantitative trait loci to mimic exposure to medications, and we examine the causal effect on Parkinson’s disease risk (in two large cohorts), age at onset and progression. We propose 23 drug-targeting mechanisms for Parkinson’s disease, including four possible drug repurposing opportunities and two drugs which may increase Parkinson’s disease risk. Of these, we put forward six drug targets with the strongest Mendelian randomization evidence. There is remarkably little overlap between our drug targets to reduce Parkinson’s disease risk versus progression, suggesting different molecular mechanisms. Drugs with genetic support are considerably more likely to succeed in clinical trials, and we provide compelling genetic evidence and an analysis pipeline to prioritise Parkinson’s disease drug development.', 'Aquaporins through the brain in health and disease: From water to gas movements. ', 'Hematoma location and morphology of anticoagulation-associated intracerebral hemorrhage. ObjectiveTo study hematoma location and morphology of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) and delineate causes and mechanism.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature research and meta-analysis of studies comparing neuroimaging findings in patients with OAC-ICH compared to those with ICH not associated with OAC (non-OAC ICH). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for ICH location using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsWe identified 8 studies including 6,259 patients (OAC-ICH n = 1,107, pooled OAC-ICH population 17.7%). There was some evidence for deep ICH location (defined as ICH in the thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule, or brainstem) being less frequent in patients with OAC-ICH (OAC-ICH: 450 of 1,102/40.8% vs non-OAC ICH: 2,656 of 4,819/55.1%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.00, p = 0.05, I2 = 0%) while cerebellar ICH location was significantly more common in OAC-ICH (OAC-ICH: 111 of 1,069/10.4% vs non-OAC ICH: 326 of 4,787/6.8%; RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12-1.89, p = 0.005, I2 = 21%) compared to non-OAC ICH. There was no statistically significant relationship to OAC use for lobar (OAC-ICH: 423 of 1,107/38.2% vs non-OAC ICH: 1,884 of 5,152/36.6%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.17, p = 0.75, I2 = 53%, p for heterogeneity = 0.04) or brainstem ICH (OAC-ICH: 36 of 546/6.6% vs non-OAC ICH: 172 of 2,626/6.5%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.58-1.87, p = 0.89, I2 = 59%, p for heterogeneity = 0.04). The risk for intraventricular extension (OAC-ICH: 436 of 840/51.9% vs non-OAC ICH: 1,429 of 3,508/40.7%; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16-1.36, p < 0.001, I2 = 0%) was significantly increased in patients with OAC-ICH. We found few data on ICH morphology in OAC-ICH vs non-OAC ICH.ConclusionThe overrepresentation of cerebellar ICH location and intraventricular extension in OAC-ICH might have mechanistic relevance for the underlying arteriopathy, pathophysiology, or bleeding pattern of OAC-ICH, and should be investigated further.', \"A walk through tau therapeutic strategies. Tau neuronal and glial pathologies drive the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease and related human tauopathies. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that pathological tau species can travel from cell to cell and spread the pathology through the brain. Throughout the last decade, physiological and pathological tau have become attractive targets for AD therapies. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed, including the inhibition of protein kinases or protein-3-O-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)-L-serine/threonine Nacetylglucosaminyl hydrolase, the inhibition of tau aggregation, active and passive immunotherapies, and tau silencing by antisense oligonucleotides. New tau therapeutics, across the board, have demonstrated the ability to prevent or reduce tau lesions and improve either cognitive or motor impairment in a variety of animal models developing neurofibrillary pathology. The most advanced strategy for the treatment of human tauopathies remains immunotherapy, which has already reached the clinical stage of drug development. Tau vaccines or humanised antibodies target a variety of tau species either in the intracellular or extracellular spaces. Some of them recognise the amino-terminus or carboxy-terminus, while others display binding abilities to the proline-rich area or microtubule binding domains. The main therapeutic foci in existing clinical trials are on Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and non-fluent primary progressive aphasia. Tau therapy offers a new hope for the treatment of many fatal brain disorders. First efficacy data from clinical trials will be available by the end of this decade.\", '3D-SSF: A bio-inspired approach for dynamic multi-subject clustering of white matter tracts. There is growing interest in the study of white matter (WM) variation across subjects, and in particular the analysis of specific WM bundles, to better understand brain development and aging, as well as to improve early detection of some diseases. Several WM multi-subject clustering methods have been proposed to study WM bundles. These methods aim to overcome the complexity of the problem, which includes the huge size of the WM tractography datasets generated from multiple subjects, the existence of various streamlines with different positions, lengths and geometric forms, as well as the presence of outliers. However, the current methods are not sufficiently flexible to address all of these constraints. Here we introduce a novel dynamic multi-subject clustering framework based on a distributed multiagent implementation of the Multiple Species Flocking model, that we name 3D-Streamlines Stream Flocking (3D-SSF). Specifically, we consider streamlines from different subjects as data streams, and each streamline is assigned to a mobile agent. Agents work together following flocking rules in order to form a flock. Thanks to a similarity function, the agents that are associated with similar streamlines form a flock, whereas the agents that are associated with dissimilar streamlines are considered outliers. We use various experiments performed on noisy synthetic and real human brain data to validate 3D-SSF and demonstrate that it is more efficient and robust to outliers compared to other classical approaches. 3D-SSF is able to extract WM bundles at a population level, while considering WM variation across subjects and eliminating outlier streamlines.', 'Spurious phase correction in rapid metabolic imaging. IDEAL-type magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) sequences require the acquisition of several datasets using optimized sampling in the time domain to reconstruct metabolite maps. Each unitary scan consists of a selective slice (2D) or slab (3D) excitation followed by an evolution time and then the acquisition of the spatially encoded signal. It is critical that the phase variation during the evolution time for each scan is only dependent on chemical shifts. In this paper, we described the apparition of spurious phase due to either the transmit or the receive frequency. The presence of this unwanted phase depends on (i) where the commutation between these two frequencies is performed and (ii) how it is done, as there are two phase commutation modes: continuous and coherent. We present the correction needed in function of the different cases. It appears that some solutions are universal. However, it is critical to know which case is implemented on the MRI scanner, which is not always easy information to have. We illustrated several cases with our preclinical MRI by using the IDEAL spiral method on a 13C phantom.']\n",
